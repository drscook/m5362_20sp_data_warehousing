Description/achievement of initiative

The Future Rangers Program is addressing a problem expressed by anti poaching rangers; lack of youth connection to wildlife. With this program being piloted in one of the highest poaching areas in the world, we aim to address the poaching crisis by helping to provide opportunities for passion, leadership training, and employment in local youth communities bordering the protected areas, as lack of employment opportunities is one of the main drivers for poaching. With leadership and skills training, the idea is to have graduates placed into jobs in the local wildlife economy.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



As a 501(c)3 nonprofit registered in the USA, we procure international donor and sponsorship-based funding which is used for local-level employment of a trained environmental educator. This educator is partnered with a school bordering a high priority conservation area, usually close to or within their community, and they work closely with the students over years to teach conservation education, mentor, and deliver leadership training. We work with local partners in the wildlife economy to pair exemplary students with job trainings, internships, and possible employment upon graduation. We track trainings, attitude and behaviour change with the students through the use of the Future Rangers app, which the educators use on a daily basis on the smart phones GCC provides as part of employment. Currently, the monitoring and evaluation, as well as a global scaling framework project is being carried out thanks to support from the National Geographic Society. To expand on a large scale, Future Rangers will be partnering with lodges for local employment funding and existing environmental education programs to target areas of conservation priority, providing passionate, local employees long-term, and providing opportunity within communities that are traditionally marginalized. We’re in the early stages of designing the program, and are moving into the secondary school phase in 2020, with much interest and collaboration from partners. We’re designing the program to be flexible and formative, so that it can be scaled quickly to others areas of conservation priority.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


We are currently building partnerships for technology sponsorship for our on-the-ground staff, which will enable us to closely track the program through our education app, which has already been developed and will be implemented within the month. We are also building partnerships in regards to leadership training, hard and soft skills training and capacity-building for our staff on the ground, which will be passed along to the students in our program. We are building an endowment fund for scholarships for outstanding students in our program.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


This initiative is in it's early stages, and is currently governed by the governance branch of the board of the non profit Global Conservation Corps, along with input from the program director and the executive director of the non profit. This initiative complies with the South African Education Standards, and currently reports progress to the National Geographic Society as the main funder. As we expand and develop our partnerships, governance structure will change to accommodate this growth. Coordination is currently basic as the program is small, but through partnerships, networks, and scaling this program is expected to grow quickly, and governance mechanisms will adjust accordingly.

The Ocean Conference  | Pescarte Project,Registered: 25 December 2019,"['goal 1""', 'goal 2""', 'goal 4""', 'goal 6""', 'goal 8""', 'goal 9""', 'goal 12', 'goal 13', 'goal 15', 'goal 16', 'goal 17']","

The Pescarte project is part of an Environmental Education Program in the Campos Basin, EAP-CB, and is a mitigating measure for Brazilian federal environmental licensing, instituted by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources-IBAMA in 2010. The program aims to articulate the Environmental Education projects, of companies that operate in the maritime oil and gas industry in the Campos Basin, aimed at the social groups affected by the socioenvironmental impacts of the licensed enterprises.
Thus the Pescarte project is a legal obligation, required by IBAMA. The project is divided into steps, called cycles. Every two-year cycle, Petrobras holds a bid to sel ect a company that will be responsible for managing the resources that will be used to implement the project, which has a total duration of 12 years. The second cycle ended in July 2019 and the third cycle will start in march 2020. The hiring of a company to manage the resources is due to the fact that the project over the 12 years and as long as it exists, will be implemented, which includes all educational actions and/or activities, under the guidance and execution of teachers , researchers and technicians at the Center for Human Sciences at the UENF and since UENF is a Public University, it cannot receive financial resources directly from Petrobras.
In Pescarte, the priority group are artisanal fishermen located in the Campos Basin territory.  The project follows specific guidelines, among them, it should strengthen social organization so that fishing communities can intervene in a qualified manner in the decision spaces on their territories.
The precarious situation in which artisanal fishermen live is common throughout the world. Fishing communities have lost their territories to pollution, oil industry, industrial fishing. In addition, they do not receive proper government support to strengthen the fish production chain. Most sell the fish for an unfair price because they have no place to benefit and store the fish, and thus establish a fair price. The Project Pescarte seeks to strengthen the social organization, through job and income generation, of fishing communities in 10 municipalities. What we have ahead is the implementation of projects such as mariculture, processing and fish storage units, which operate under the principles of solidarity economy and cooperativism. However, although there are many challenges, we have mobilized a group of fishermen who have been participating in the project for almost 6 years and who have won a number of victories with the government to access more rights. Artisanal fishers have occupied spaces in the council of councilors, river basin committees, environmental councils, among others.
Another important information is that we perform one of the largest fishing censuses in the southeastern region of Brazil, and one of the data we have reached is that much of the fishing community suffers from food insecurity. All census data and the project in general, have a network of researchers, mainly from UENF, which has been dedicated to research all information, to assist in the direction of public policies.

The Ocean Conference  | Clean Sea LIFE - fighting marine litter in Italy,Registered: 19 December 2019,['goal 15'],"

Clean Sea LIFE project, co-financed by the European Union's LIFE programme, fights marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea with a campaign to raise awareness in citizen, operators and authorities, inspire changes in attitude, encourage co-responsibility and promote good waste management. 
The specific objectives are:
1. to increase awareness on ML, empowering citizens to become part of the solution 
2. to remove existing litter, including lost fishing gear, and prevent further littering
3. to promote ""fishing for litter"" initiatives and train professional fishermen in responsible practices
4. to provide guidelines for the management of ML, increase exchange of knowledge and the uptake of best practices, assisting authorities achieve a Good Environmental Status.
In the first 3 years, Clean Sea LIFE has directly involved 23.200 people in public events (conferences, clean-ups, school classes, regattas, presentations); over 1.275.000 visitors took part in trade fairs where the CSL project was presented, and several million citizens were exposed to both the project and its messages on marine litter through an extensive coverage on National, regional, local and specialized media. So far, 13.850 people took the Clean Sea LIFE pledge to prevent littering, engage in clean-ups, and reduce, reuse and recycle more. Far more clubs, associations and training agencies than planned took the Clean Sea LIFE pledge and started organizing regular clean-ups and raising the awareness of their students and clients on marine litter.
From banning microbeads in cosmetics or plastic cotton buds, to a law extending our fishing for litter activities to all fishermen in Italy, to banning the mass release of balloons in local councils, the Clean Sea LIFE project has already shaped legislation that is reducing the amount of litter affecting the Mediterranean sea.

Description/achievement of initiative

The Students Senate (SS) is a school-based project with the aim of providing, effective demand-driven, context-specific and evidence-based policy advice and technical assistance to position young people to amplify their voices and shape their understanding on sustainable development through moderated intellectual discussions on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The objectives include, Promote and support young people in intellectual engagements on sustainable development, Mentor young people into positive social change champions, Mobilize and amplify young people’s voices on sustainable development.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



The student senate is run in form of a parliamentary session (SENATE) where students, teacher and other stake holders come together to debate and discuss different topics and targets on the various SDGS. The senate is moderated by a student and a co-moderator who is always representative from partner institution who also serves as a key note speaker on the particular topic of the SDG under discussion.
The senate debate streams live on social media platforms of the organisation and people from different parts of the world are able to contribute to the discussion online. 
After the senate debate, reports are prepared, discussed and shared with key stakeholders like government for implementation of the recommendations.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Training and capacity building sessions are arranged for students, teacher and partners to foster understand and active participation and involvement in the implementation of the SDGS.,



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The student senate is implemented by Uiniversal Health and Development Foundation (UHDF). UHDF Is an advocacy, research and services linking organization based in Uganda working towards promoting and improving the health and well-being of people through health promotion, health literacy & communication, economic empowerment and capacity building, and linkages to quality health and other social services. UHDF serves as the secretariat for the initiative. 
There is an advisory board established to guide and streamline the operations of the student senate. This board is composed of ten (10) representatives from Ministry of Education, Local council government, office of the prime minister, Local CSOs, Schools, church and cultural institutions.
In schools, we have established a development clubs starting with 15 members who are trained to steer the senate at school level with support from school patron who is a teacher in same particular school.

COMMUNITIES BUILDING CONSENSUS AROUND SDG - 17 CONSENSUS FOR VENEZUELA - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 18 December 2019,"['Goal 8', '\n\n\nGoal 11', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description/achievement of initiative

By 2021, SDG implementation in Venezuela is co-driven by an alliance of civil society, economy and academy through NGO initiatives appointing to achieve the 17 SDG 2030. Around of each one of the 17 ODS, communities will be formed to communicate on virtual platforms and forums (round tables), as well as promote and supported each other. A common action plan will be worked out in consensus, which includes coordination with politics, government and international development agencies. Finally, the SDG-Communities are connected and interacting with global communities sharing values of sustainable development, compromised with a safe world for future generations.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



There is a special focus on consensus building in communities around each one of the 17 SDGs, using the new austrian-german “Systemisches KONSENSIEREN”. Therefore ways and methods will be look for and tried out, in order to detect and determine the most efficient and effective manners of collaboration, in harmony with the NGOs own goals and work. Second focus lies on financial sustainability of this activity; here different sources will be contacted in order to find out, how far we can receive financement and even redirect funds into certain NGOs of special importance and interest. Third focus lies on creation of processes and its documentation in order to offer guidance and permanency.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Right from beginning, Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer will be promoted, facilitated and enforced through strategic alliances with NGOs, economic associations and the academy.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


This is a Bottom-up activity. There is a team of three in general coordination, responsible for all planning, executing and administration, with assisting staff, if necessary. For each of the development goals, there will be one NGO or business association taking the lead of the “round tables of consensus” with two co-leading organizations. Responsibility includes to unite groups of participants on local, regional and national level, if applies. Organise regular meetings throughout the year and maintain virtual section of web-site and other social media updated. Within of frame of yearly event FORUM SUSTAINABLE VENEZUELA - AGENDA ODS 2030 - 17 CONSENSUS, each of SDG-Communities will be given opportunity to present to general public, present cases from other countries, from all over the world and coordinate the yearly SDG-Community workshop. There indicators and achievement of activities will be presented, discussed and new consensus agreed for the next period. Throughout the year contact with national state SDG activities is fostered as well as with international development agencies.

The Ocean Conference  | Creating a vision to guide development of a sustainable ocean future: the Future Seas 2030 initiative,Registered: 18 December 2019,"['goal 1""', 'goal 2""', 'goal 3""', 'goal 4""', 'goal 5""', 'goal 6""', 'goal 7""', 'goal 8""', 'goal 9""', 'goal 10', 'goal 11', 'goal 12', 'goal 13', 'goal 15', 'goal 16', 'goal 17']","

The Future Seas project develops evidence-informed scenarios of the future in 2030, for each of 12 Key Challenges facing the world's oceans. The project then generates a tangible plan for possible actions at local, regional and global scales to undertake to achieve the 2030 vision most in line with an equitable and sustainable future.

Participants: Future Seas is a unique collaboration, spearheaded by the Centre for Marine Socioecology, of over 100 researchers from the University of Tasmania (UTAS), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other institutions. Within UTAS, members come from the Colleges of Arts, Law and Education, Health and Medicine, and Sciences and Engineering. The collaboration includes psychologists, public health and education experts, philosophers, ecologists, oceanographers, climate modelers, economists, social scientists, engineers, information and communications technology researchers, as well as governance, law and policy experts. Approximately 40% of the Future Seas group are PhD students and Early Career Researchers, providing an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers with the skills, experience and expertise necessary to help address some of the complex interdisciplinary challenges faced by society today. In addition to the Australian-based researchers, 12 Indigenous Leaders and Traditional Knowledge Holders from around the world are leading the drafting of their own key challenge for the oceans, as well as contributing much needed perspectives to the other challenges.

Approach: Future Seas uses a strategic technique called Foresighting to develop evidence-informed plausible scenarios of the future by 2030, for each of the challenges. The scenarios include what the future would look like if current trends continue, and also what our future could look like if we more effectively used the data and knowledge currently available to us, and pushed as far as possible towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We then use Backcasting (i.e. working backwards from the desirable future) to generate a tangible plan for possible actions to undertake at local, regional and global scales, if society chose to work towards the future more in line with the UN SDGs. We take a broad and interdisciplinary look at what processes have been and could be effective for leveraging change. Uniquely, in addition to management, policy and governance actions, our collaboration is exploring what approaches have been used in Psychology, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Public Health for human behaviour change across all levels of intervention. The field of psychology has generated a body of evidence about the design and efficacy of behaviour change interventions for individuals, organisations and communities. This research has mainly been applied to health literacy and behaviours, however, the principles and mechanisms inform models of change that can be applied to other real-world challenges, such as marine environmental issues. The field of ICT has informed measurement of human behaviour, cognition and environmental psychology perspectives that underpins technology enabled behaviour change. Psychology is also moving increasingly in synergy with the fields of computing and technology to maximise the reach, innovation and sustainability of change interventions, whether they be programs for individuals or whole communities.

European Energy Efficiency Fund (eeef) investing in sustainable energy projects in Europe - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 18 December 2019,"['Goal 7', '\n\n\nGoal 11', '\n\n\nGoal 13']","
Description/achievement of initiative

Advancing Sustainable Energy for Europe: i) to deliver sustainable green infrastructure to cities; ii) ensure efficient use of resources and of renewable resources by the public users, allow access to clean energy sources (electricity or heat ) to citizens; iii) generating revenues for communities via selling green electricity into the grid; iv) upgrading infrastructure in deprived communities; v) implementing projects in cities in the frame of circular economy initiatives or smart technology concepts.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



This initiative is carried out by investing into projects that have been identified by public authorities to improve their communities' carbon footprint via facilitating investments including i) energy efficiency inc. public building upgrades and upgrades of public street lighting infrastructure, ii) renovating district heating networks and iii) replacing heat supply capacities with renewable energy sources. The eeef is approached for financing by private parties that have been awarded a public concession or an energy supply agreement with a public body. For a project to be awarded a concession, it needs to complete the public procurement process. The eeef considers project for investment once concessions have been awarded. The Fund has various ways  to invest into projects i) it can provide funding to a project vehicle that has been set up by a private party that holds the concession for a public assets to be upgraded or to implement a renewable energy project ii) it can invest equity into a project vehicle that has been set by a private party that holds a concession for a public asset that is to be upgraded or in the case of a renewable energy project newly built iii) it can provide funding directly to the public authority or to the entity set up by the public authority dedicated to conduct the upgrade works or construct the new sustainable energy supply capacities iv) it can buy receivables from a private company that has performed the construction/renovation works in accordance to the agreement with the public authority. In this case the project is structured in such a way that the public authority is repaying the investment from the energy savings (without constraining its budget) v) it can invest together with a private entity in a number of projects including district heating networks to supply renewable heat and electricity to a public entity to a price lower than the base case (of when the project was generating with fossil fuels). The eeef can also be approached directly by public authorities that are seeking financing for their energy efficiency or renewable energy initiatives. The other implementation instrument that the initiative is using  is a Technical Assistance facility, which will be described below.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


To prepare local energy efficiency upgrade projects is complex and often challenging for public entities due to the need to i) conduct energy audits, ii) calculate potential energy savings, iii) propose and select new equipment for replacement, iv) prepare the bidding process, v) evaluate the tender and vi) select the company to implement the project. This process can take up to 3 years for Cities, especially when they have large populations > 200k. The eeef understands the complexity of such projects and since the inception of the Fund has been equipped with a Technical Assistance facility. Initially this was provided by the European Commission and this TAF successfully fulfilled its objective by supporting project development at the public level. Between 2011 and 2016 the facility supported over 30 public entities, facilitating over EUR 400 m in investments, some of which were financed by the eeef including the City of Santander in Spain, the City of Venlo in the Netherlands, the Alentejo region in Portugal and Region Rhone Alpes in France. When the Technical Assistance facility from the European Commission came to an end, the eeef continued to develop this important resource by building a new facility to support public entities to prepare their investment programmes. Since 2014 the Fund has allocated part of its revenues to its own technical assistance facility. These funds have been supplemented by additional funding provided by ELENA, under the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Union. The eeef's Technical Assistance facility (eeef TAF)  builds on the experience gained from its predecessor facility. The current technical assistance is structured in a way that provides services to public entities to i) conduct energy audits, ii) prepare procurement documents, iii) conduct the energy service company selection process  to realise renovation measures and iv) select financing instruments. These services are paid for by the fund (the advisors were selected via a competitive and process where the advisor pitched to conduct the aforementioned services) and contribute to build capacity within the public authorities. Once the public tender has been awarded, the Fund is available to finance the renovation measures.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The eeef has been established and capitalised by the European Commission to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy and clean public transportation at the level of public entities, cities, communities. The fund can support  eligible projects via different financing instruments. When a project/investment has been identified by the public authority and published for tender when a private company is selected to realise the project implementation, funding from the fund could flow into the project implementation vehicles or finance the investment directly. All investment proposals identified must be in line with the investment guidelines of the fund. These clearly stipulate investments criteria in general, comprising exclusion list and pro area of investment defined parameters for investment. All investment proposals, once they have been reviewed from a technical, legal and financial point of view, will be tabled for approval by the eeef's independent investment committee. Once approved, the Fund invests via project vehicles or the investment is paid directly to the private company awarded the tender. Funds will be disbursed in line with construction progress. The Fund has established a reporting mechanism for all projects comply with.  The reporting is reviewed by the Investment Manager of the Fund and distributed to investors. The Governing bodies of the Fund are represented by investors that review activities of the Fund on a regular basis and also outline and refine the investment strategy of the Fund. The eeef is a regulated vehicle by the Luxembourgish authority CSSF which oversees activities of the fund.

Description/achievement of initiative

A critical issue of worldwide concern is antibiotic resistance creating threats to global health, food security, and development and Carbon gas is predicted to produce global warming and droughts. This project combats the need for non-therapeutic antibiotics in livestock production while maintaining growth, reducing resources and reducing carbon emissions of ruminant livestock. In order to achieve global food security and improve quality/functionality under changing global climate, the goals in this 4-year project target the education of livestock management, an R&D project on better ruminant nutrition and trials documenting the reduction in carbon emissions through better nutrition.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



This project will be broken down into several phases: Phase 1 – Begin the education process.  ProAgni has developed content on antibiotic resistance and the responsible use of antibiotics in animal production. They will present approximately six presentations at industry and academic events within the next 12 months.  The education process will continue throughout the project with the overall aim of 15 events over 5 years.  Phase 2 - Improve Ruminant Livestock Digestion to reduce Carbon Emissions, reduce by developing an additional nutritional supplement. ProAgni is in the process of developing a new nutritional supplement that is focused on significantly reducing induction times in intensive feeding systems using shelf stable probiotics. This will improve and support ruminant nutrition creating better overall nutrition absorption for ruminant species.  After development is completed, the product will be trialled and tested on ruminant and non-ruminant livestock.  Phase 3 – Test the methane produced by cattle on the current grain diet to create a baseline.  Test cattle on antibiotic free ration and measure differences in emissions.  After completion on new nutritional supplement, another round of testing will commence documenting improvements in methane levels produced.  Phase 4 - Trial – Run and ongoing test at a farm/feedlot site to determine the amount of antibiotics in the soil and water supply prior to switching to feed containing no antibiotics. Measure through 5 generations of cattle and track changes in antibiotic levels in soil and water in the surrounding area.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Provide useful data and evidence to support the removal of antibiotics from livestock production and the following SDGs [Goal 2] By promoting agriculture and agricultural technology that reduces the resources needed for ruminant livestock, removes the need for non-therapeutic antibiotics and reduces carbon emissions produced, this project helps create sustainable, resilient agriculture, producing more food and supporting family farmers. [Goal 3] Systemic antibiotic use is contributing to antimicrobial resistance. A large portion of antibiotics fed to animals are used to promote growth or to control acidosis. Reducing the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, this project supports better health world-wide by helping to ensure antibiotics still work and are not excreted into the soil and water supplies.  [Goal 5] We support family owned farms, many of which are female run.[Goal 6] By reducing the production time of ruminant livestock, we reduce the amount of water needed to raise livestock. By removing antibiotics from the food chain, the risk of contaminants flowing into wetlands and rivers is reduced or removed.[Goal 8] Per the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock LAMP Responsible use of antibiotics promotes economic growth by supporting healthy and productive animals.[Goal 12] This project promotes sustainable use of resources by decreasing the amount of water needed to produce ruminant livestock and reducing losses in production by supporting livestock through the dramatic changes to nutritional demands that occur directly prior to the birthing process. Preparation for these changes is critical for offspring survival, immunity and vigour.  By increasing immunity in offspring through better colostrum volumes and quality, we decrease nutritional stress, increase survivability of offspring.[Goal 13] Greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants are largely a by-product of inefficient feed conversion. Dietary manipulation is the most effective and convenient way to reduce methane emissions and increase nitrogen utilization efficiency. ProAgni reduces emissions by making feed conversion more efficient, and replacing empty calories, with nutrient dense supplementation. Measuring emissions per kilogram of meat produced, ProAgni are reducing emissions by nearly 50% when compared to cattle on other non-medicated feeds. [Goal 15] This project supports responsible use of resources, especially land and water by increasing feed efficiency, better utilisation of resources and removal of potential harmful additives from livestock excretions.  With better feed efficiency, less land is required, current land can be better utilized, and antibiotics are removed from the feed decreasing potential contaminants in the soil, water and potential degradation of land.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The initiative will be implemented using a project management approach. The high level of management will be a project management team with leadership of a project manager from ProAgni Pty Ltd. The project will form appropriate committees to manage its activities as a means for internal controls. The initiative will use a matrix approach and a bottom up approach with regards to monitoring and reporting.

Upcycle Ocean Plastic - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 16 December 2019,['Goal 14'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

A lot of what we believe in isn’t revolutionary. Cleaner oceans. Sustainable lifestyles. Waste as a resource. Every year, more than eight million tons of plastic trash land in the ocean. Tide Ocean SA admits to reprocess ocean, coastlines and uncontrolled ocean side landfills plastic and up-cycle this valuable raw material that can be used in a range of sustainable products such as hard plastic products and textiles made from 100% ocean related plastic. Tide Ocean SA believes in the necessity of a circular economy and protecting the environment.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



The Tide labeled raw material is tested and produced in partnership with the Institute for Materials Technology and Plastics Processing (IWK), a branch of the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für Technik) in Rapperswil, Switzerland. Together, IWK and #tide have developed a formula that regenerates the plastic granules and reverses the damage caused by the UV rays and salt water the plastic trash was exposed to while floating in the ocean or washed ashore. Additionally it is compounded with the help of solar energy to reduce the carbon footprint during production stage.

Tide is processing all kinds of plastic, not just PET bottles. Hard plastics like shampoo bottles and plastic containers can be used to recreate new plastic products such as watches, furniture and electronic devices, or in the interior of a car. Additionally Tide has successfully achieved to create a yarn for apparel, home & office interiors, carpets or bags.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Tide has capacity to process more than 1'000 tons of plastic within its compounding center in Switzerland plus it has further potential due to the strong partnership with Institute for Materials Technology and Plastics Processing (IWK), a branch of the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für Technik) in Rapperswil, Switzerland



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


Tide has partnered up with local organisations and local people in South East Asia (Phillipines & Thailand) to pay the local collection a specific price per collected ocean plastic. This income will enable the collector to make a living and support his family and local ecosystem.

Description/achievement of initiative

The University of South Florida has identified the need to formalize a central hub for SDG-related work at the university. From initial planning conducted by USF’s Patel College of Sustainability, an action plan was developed to establish the SDG Action Alliance. The mission of the Alliance is to align the university’s operations, governance and community with the objectives of the UN SDGs. The role of the Alliance is to capture and distribute SDG-related work in order to build new partnerships, access new funding streams, and promote the university as a leader in global awareness and responsible research.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Methodologies developed by the taskforce, coordinator, and subsequent Action Alliance steering committee will take the form of a mission, vision, and goals tableau, as well as other supporting procedures for implementing SDG work at USF and for reporting activities. Interdepartmental programming is planned to include resources and support from Student Affairs, USF World, Student Green Energy Fund, Student Government, and other strategic partners in order to reach the greatest audience for participation. The Action Alliance will help to promote SDG work such as global citizens education, environmental studies, and projects which involve sustainability and green energy in curricular and extracurricular capacities. Workshops and technical trainings will be hosted through the Action Alliance which focus on integrating the SDGs into curriculum, university policies and decisions, financing and procurement, campus services, facilities, and other institutional structures and vehicles.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


As a showcase of SDG-related work at USF, the SDG Action Alliance will promote the awareness of ongoing projects to a broad network of stakeholders at the university, within the region, and beyond via media and reporting platforms. In addition, one prominent goal of the Action Alliance is to generate streams of funding that are available to conduct SDG-related work; therefore, the steering committee will actively maintain a database of resources which include funding for research and programming. Trainings and technical certifications related to SDG work will also be promoted. The Action Alliance will prioritize support for SDG work among student research by encouraging SDG-related curricula that is experiential and interdisciplinary.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


In order to establish the SDG Action Alliance at USF, a task force and coordinator will first be established among stakeholders who hold an active interest in drafting the procedures and implementation plan for the initiative. Students from USF’s Patel College of Global Sustainability were tasked with researching existing UN SDG Partnerships, as well as identifying ongoing SDG work already being conducted at USF, in order to draft best practices and management strategies centered around a formalized hub, now known as the USF SDG Action Alliance. Plans for the Action Alliance shall be enacted in the form of a steering committee comprised of students, staff, and faculty from across the campus. Initially, the Action Alliance will be housed under the Patel College and in partnership with the Office of Sustainability. Centralized efforts will be made to streamline data collection and project ideation using the Action Alliance and resources from the USF community. Other coordination of SDG work will involve regular meetings with top administrators at the university and an annual retreat for stakeholders.

Description/achievement of initiative

Presently climate change is moving faster than we can imaging, some scientists are already predicting that sea level rise could double from what is currently projected by the end of this century. Our local Zongo communities are vulnerable to the effect of climate change. We have no knowledge of climate change. We seek to find the natural and human activities that causes Climate Change, its effect on the communities and our children. Aiming at educating our people on waste management, strengthen the participation of our local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Find measures to build climate resilient society.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Global warming and changing of our natural environment characteristics, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind and several weather events which is course by both natural and human activities is rapidly knocking the door for annihilation. We therefore wants to look at different climate change related risk that threaten Zongo Communities. The Initiative will be carried out in all Zongo Community in Ghana Starting from Ayawaso Municipality, Ayawaso East Municipality and the La-nkwantanang Madina Municipal assemblies all in the greater Accra Region of Ghana.  And latter extend in to reach all the one thousand, and eighty (1,080) Zongo communities in Ghana. We will research on policies, initiatives and programs of the government to mitigate the effect of climate change by looking at the accessibility of Ghana's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (Ghana INDC), is it reaching its target objectives, how effective is the programs and what can be done to improve it. Lobby government for equitable distribution and access to safe and affordable drinking water for all in our zongo communities.
The initiative will also help in raising awareness among schools children and out of schools youth on the need to imbibe positive attitudes toward their local environment. How the children can help reduce some of the human actions that causes climate change such as bush burning, indiscriminate plastic waste disposal, water management and excessive uses of electric energy in the communities.
We will organize community forums, trainings and workshops on climate change knowledge, its impact and ways to prevent the human courses. We are going to create Climate Change Ambassadors (CCA) among the school children and community members to motivate them take up the project serious and also help in tree planting activities and maintenance till it grows. Climate Change Ambassadors will be encouraged to carryout individual or collective community project(s) on Climate Change mitigation in their schools and immediate environment. Periodic award and prizes to best projects and areas that will maintain their trees to grow. 
”Live No One Behind” implementation this project we will try not to leave anyone behind. The people will not only be inform, but they would be involve in all activities so that we can all help to achieve the 2030 Agenda. 
The organization will open itself, ready to partner any organizations that give free access to their facility or partner to carry out the initiatives.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


The organization will collaborate with financial institutions, corporate bodies, governmental institutions, Local and International NGOs to organize a periodic community leadership training, climate change workshop and seminars to build the capacity of the community to be self-reliance and productive for sustainable development of the individual and the community, people will also be encourage to share knowledge or experience they gain to other. With technology transfer we plan to put the data on the environmental issue, reports to public usage. Community Leaders including Municipal Chief Executives, service providers, and opinion leaders, chiefs, Imams, Pastors, Youth Leaders and Assembly members will be encouraged to take a very active role in achieving the objectives of the initiatives in other to help empower the communities and Ghana at large. Beneficiaries will have to transfer knowledge of SDG goal 6 and 13 to their peers and other community members.  Strengthen the role of volunteerism to achieve the SDGs especially goal 6 and 13.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The Executive Members of the organization with other partners will collaborate with stakeholders, Ministries, the Local Government Authorities and the Municipalities to coordinate in implementing the project; facilitators will be selected to train and empower the people. Community involvement and participation will be given high priority for the project to achieve its objectives, the Program Director Will be task to plan Activities on how to reach out to the partners and the community; awareness creation, research & data collection, lobbying and Advocacy will be major part in coordinating the project.
We also look at some possible programs aim to provide children’s perspective to discussion of climate change with peers, and how children’s resilience could be strengthened for them to take up climate change education by creating Child Climate Change Ambassadors (3CA) in Schools and Climate Change  Ambassadors (CCA)  for youth and out of school children, they will then coordinate with their schools and nearby community to create awareness in schools and surrounding communities,  the initiative will also promote tree planting activities by collaborating with the Ghana Forestry Commission

[Goal 3] Systemic antibiotic use is contributing to antimicrobial resistance. A large portion of antibiotics fed to animals are used to promote growth or to control acidosis. Reducing the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, this project supports better health world-wide by helping to ensure antibiotics still work and are not excreted into the soil and water supplies.  [Goal 5] We support family owned farms, many of which are female run.[Goal 6] By reducing the production time of ruminant livestock, we reduce the amount of water needed to raise livestock. By removing antibiotics from the food chain, the risk of contaminants flowing into wetlands and rivers is reduced or removed.[Goal 8] Per the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock LAMP Responsible use of antibiotics promotes economic growth by supporting healthy and productive animals.[Goal 12] This project promotes sustainable use of resources by decreasing the amount of water needed to produce ruminant livestock and reducing losses in production by supporting livestock through the dramatic changes to nutritional demands that occur directly prior to the birthing process. Preparation for these changes is critical for offspring survival, immunity and vigour.  By increasing immunity in offspring through better colostrum volumes and quality, we decrease nutritional stress, increase survivability of offspring.[Goal 13] Greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants are largely a by-product of inefficient feed conversion. Dietary manipulation is the most effective and convenient way to reduce methane emissions and increase nitrogen utilization efficiency. ProAgni reduces emissions by making feed conversion more efficient, and replacing empty calories, with nutrient dense supplementation. Measuring emissions per kilogram of meat produced, ProAgni are reducing emissions by nearly 50% when compared to cattle on other non-medicated feeds. [Goal 15] This project supports responsible use of resources, especially land and water by increasing feed efficiency, better utilisation of resources and removal of potential harmful additives from livestock excretions.  With better feed efficiency, less land is required, current land can be better utilized, and antibiotics are removed from the feed decreasing potential contaminants in the soil, water and potential degradation of land.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The initiative will be implemented using a project management approach. The high level of management will be a project management team with leadership of a project manager from ProAgni Pty Ltd. The project will form appropriate committees to manage its activities as a means for internal controls. The initiative will use a matrix approach and a bottom up approach with regards to monitoring and reporting.

Upcycle Ocean Plastic - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 16 December 2019,['Goal 14'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

A lot of what we believe in isnâ€™t revolutionary. Cleaner oceans. Sustainable lifestyles. Waste as a resource. Every year, more than eight million tons of plastic trash land in the ocean. Tide Ocean SA admits to reprocess ocean, coastlines and uncontrolled ocean side landfills plastic and up-cycle this valuable raw material that can be used in a range of sustainable products such as hard plastic products and textiles made from 100% ocean related plastic. Tide Ocean SA believes in the necessity of a circular economy and protecting the environment.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



The Tide labeled raw material is tested and produced in partnership with the Institute for Materials Technology and Plastics Processing (IWK), a branch of the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik) in Rapperswil, Switzerland. Together, IWK and #tide have developed a formula that regenerates the plastic granules and reverses the damage caused by the UV rays and salt water the plastic trash was exposed to while floating in the ocean or washed ashore. Additionally it is compounded with the help of solar energy to reduce the carbon footprint during production stage.

Tide is processing all kinds of plastic, not just PET bottles. Hard plastics like shampoo bottles and plastic containers can be used to recreate new plastic products such as watches, furniture and electronic devices, or in the interior of a car. Additionally Tide has successfully achieved to create a yarn for apparel, home & office interiors, carpets or bags.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Tide has capacity to process more than 1'000 tons of plastic within its compounding center in Switzerland plus it has further potential due to the strong partnership with Institute for Materials Technology and Plastics Processing (IWK), a branch of the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik) in Rapperswil, Switzerland



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


Tide has partnered up with local organisations and local people in South East Asia (Phillipines & Thailand) to pay the local collection a specific price per collected ocean plastic. This income will enable the collector to make a living and support his family and local ecosystem.

Description/achievement of initiative

The University of South Florida has identified the need to formalize a central hub for SDG-related work at the university. From initial planning conducted by USFâ€™s Patel College of Sustainability, an action plan was developed to establish the SDG Action Alliance. The mission of the Alliance is to align the universityâ€™s operations, governance and community with the objectives of the UN SDGs. The role of the Alliance is to capture and distribute SDG-related work in order to build new partnerships, access new funding streams, and promote the university as a leader in global awareness and responsible research.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Methodologies developed by the taskforce, coordinator, and subsequent Action Alliance steering committee will take the form of a mission, vision, and goals tableau, as well as other supporting procedures for implementing SDG work at USF and for reporting activities. Interdepartmental programming is planned to include resources and support from Student Affairs, USF World, Student Green Energy Fund, Student Government, and other strategic partners in order to reach the greatest audience for participation. The Action Alliance will help to promote SDG work such as global citizens education, environmental studies, and projects which involve sustainability and green energy in curricular and extracurricular capacities. Workshops and technical trainings will be hosted through the Action Alliance which focus on integrating the SDGs into curriculum, university policies and decisions, financing and procurement, campus services, facilities, and other institutional structures and vehicles.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


As a showcase of SDG-related work at USF, the SDG Action Alliance will promote the awareness of ongoing projects to a broad network of stakeholders at the university, within the region, and beyond via media and reporting platforms. In addition, one prominent goal of the Action Alliance is to generate streams of funding that are available to conduct SDG-related work; therefore, the steering committee will actively maintain a database of resources which include funding for research and programming. Trainings and technical certifications related to SDG work will also be promoted. The Action Alliance will prioritize support for SDG work among student research by encouraging SDG-related curricula that is experiential and interdisciplinary.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


In order to establish the SDG Action Alliance at USF, a task force and coordinator will first be established among stakeholders who hold an active interest in drafting the procedures and implementation plan for the initiative. Students from USFâ€™s Patel College of Global Sustainability were tasked with researching existing UN SDG Partnerships, as well as identifying ongoing SDG work already being conducted at USF, in order to draft best practices and management strategies centered around a formalized hub, now known as the USF SDG Action Alliance. Plans for the Action Alliance shall be enacted in the form of a steering committee comprised of students, staff, and faculty from across the campus. Initially, the Action Alliance will be housed under the Patel College and in partnership with the Office of Sustainability. Centralized efforts will be made to streamline data collection and project ideation using the Action Alliance and resources from the USF community. Other coordination of SDG work will involve regular meetings with top administrators at the university and an annual retreat for stakeholders.

Description/achievement of initiative

Presently climate change is moving faster than we can imaging, some scientists are already predicting that sea level rise could double from what is currently projected by the end of this century. Our local Zongo communities are vulnerable to the effect of climate change. We have no knowledge of climate change. We seek to find the natural and human activities that causes Climate Change, its effect on the communities and our children. Aiming at educating our people on waste management, strengthen the participation of our local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Find measures to build climate resilient society.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Global warming and changing of our natural environment characteristics, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind and several weather events which is course by both natural and human activities is rapidly knocking the door for annihilation. We therefore wants to look at different climate change related risk that threaten Zongo Communities. The Initiative will be carried out in all Zongo Community in Ghana Starting from Ayawaso Municipality, Ayawaso East Municipality and the La-nkwantanang Madina Municipal assemblies all in the greater Accra Region of Ghana.  And latter extend in to reach all the one thousand, and eighty (1,080) Zongo communities in Ghana. We will research on policies, initiatives and programs of the government to mitigate the effect of climate change by looking at the accessibility of Ghana's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (Ghana INDC), is it reaching its target objectives, how effective is the programs and what can be done to improve it. Lobby government for equitable distribution and access to safe and affordable drinking water for all in our zongo communities.
The initiative will also help in raising awareness among schools children and out of schools youth on the need to imbibe positive attitudes toward their local environment. How the children can help reduce some of the human actions that causes climate change such as bush burning, indiscriminate plastic waste disposal, water management and excessive uses of electric energy in the communities.
We will organize community forums, trainings and workshops on climate change knowledge, its impact and ways to prevent the human courses. We are going to create Climate Change Ambassadors (CCA) among the school children and community members to motivate them take up the project serious and also help in tree planting activities and maintenance till it grows. Climate Change Ambassadors will be encouraged to carryout individual or collective community project(s) on Climate Change mitigation in their schools and immediate environment. Periodic award and prizes to best projects and areas that will maintain their trees to grow. 
â€Live No One Behindâ€ implementation this project we will try not to leave anyone behind. The people will not only be inform, but they would be involve in all activities so that we can all help to achieve the 2030 Agenda. 
The organization will open itself, ready to partner any organizations that give free access to their facility or partner to carry out the initiatives.

Description

                            Our world has become increasingly complex, volatile and uncertain. Education plays a crucial role in preparing young people for a future of complex challenges such as globalization, digitalization and climate change. Siemens Stiftung offers high-quality science and technology education in order to provide young learners with the relevant knowledge to understand scientific and technical interrelations. Additionally, skills such as creative problem solving, the ability to innovate, and critical thinking â€“ known as â€œ21st century skillsâ€ â€“ are increasingly important for openly embracing change and conscientiously shaping the future. This is why Siemens Stiftung has recently introduced â€œSTEM and creativityâ€ into its international education program by integrating design thinking as a new teaching method in STEM lessons. Thus, with the â€œDesign Thinking in STEMâ€ project, Siemens Stiftung combines STEM education with creative processes to encourage innovative thinking among young people. The project is aimed at developing approaches for teaching these abilities in science and technology lessons. The design thinking method encourages students to address challenges with a sense of empathy, viewing a problem through the eyes of someone actually confronting it. Through interdisciplinary teamwork, ideas and approaches are turned into physical prototypes early in the process to be tested and evaluated. 
The main focus of the project is on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, established by the United Nations. They provide the thematic structure for the interdisciplinary STEM lessons and the use of the design thinking methodology. Typically, the iterative design thinking process starts with the formulation of a specific challenge. A multidisciplinary team will then develop a concrete solution for the problem, keeping the user at the heart of the process. In this project, we suggest teachers and students to choose their challenge from the SDGs, these including the economic, social, and environmental challenges of the 21st century, which are growing in their local impact alongside their global relevance. Complex STEM topics can be explained through specific problems, such as clean drinking water or sustainable power generation, while design thinking makes these problems more approachable. 
Design thinking is a very suitable method in addressing the subjects of the SDGs since due to their complexity most of the goals require a multidisciplinary approach which is a core element of the design thinking mind set. Furthermore, the SDGs are of global interest and require local action. The design thinking approach usually defines a concrete problem from the local context and develops the optimal solution for the challenge. Its solution-based approach supports young learners in nurturing their creativity and preparing an innovative mind set which is required to openly embrace current and future challenges and responsibly contribute to our society.
                        
Expected impact

                            Intended impact: We believe that high-quality STEM education is a global prerequisite for individual development and participation in a technology-driven world, which is why we focus our education program on science and technology. Additionally, skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and the ability to innovate are increasingly important for openly embracing change and responsibly shaping the future.
Input quality: Our cooperation partner The Index Project has practised the use of the methodology in education in multiple projects  in more than 700 schools and has evaluated its impact in the target groups. Well established network of participants: the participants of our workshops is based on our network of STEM teachers and multipliers that have been trained in our Experimento program since years (up today 2.400 teachers/ 1.200.000 children worldwide) and are experienced in innovative education methods. 
Output quality: Monitoring and evaluating the impact of our work is very important to us. In South Africa, where the project has been started in early 2019, the Schools Development Unit is monitoring the project, evaluating the use of the new methods in STEM lessons, and assessing student development. For our project in Latin America, we will build on the instruments and experiences from the evaluation process in South Africa and are planning monitoring in cooperation with local partners such as Pontificia Universidad de Chile in Villarrica and Valparaiso.
Outcome: For any successful shift in education, teachers play a key role, which is why our project â€œDesign Thinking in STEMâ€ addresses the following two target groups of the outcome level: as â€œagents of changeâ€, it is teachers that create conditions for encouraging creativity and prepare a solution-oriented, innovative mindset among young learners. This is why, first of all, our project supports educators in their own creativity to design contemporary, interdisciplinary and creative lessons while addressing the SDGs. Second, young learners are being empowered to develop meaningful, innovative solutions and sustainable in the classroom and enabled to solve newly emerging problems. The design thinking method is a fitting approach for developing these skills, and by incorporating it into schools, we emphasize our talents and abilities.
Content sustainability: Together with The Index Project, we support educators and participants in preparing the workshops and support them in their implementation of the methodology in their teaching. Our project is linked to the conditions requested by local curricula; there is an option to combine it with additional activities such as regional/national Science Expo etc. Our project is planned for long term application (more than 3 years) and secured in an existing network of Siemens Stiftung and our cooperation partners.
Outcome/Numbers: With one teachersâ€™ training (30 participants) we will be able to reach 10.000 students over the course of 5 years (based on our 9 years experience of teacher trainings with our Experimento program). 
We are actively involved in forums and associations (i.E. STEAM Forums) in the respective regions advocating for a contemporary and high quality STEM education for sustainable development and sharing knowledge and experiences

Description/achievement of initiative

<p>The overall objective of PEP&rsquo;s commitment is to support and increase evidence-based policy making in nine African countries. The immediate objective is to develop the capacity of local experts to produce a reliable evidence base on youth employment issues, while engaging with policy to ensure uptake in decision and advisory processes. PEP will &nbsp;support local researchers to carry out contextualized research and policy engagement activities through nine projects supported by PEP&rsquo;s current core donors: DFID, IDRC and Hewlett Foundation. The commitment will run for three years from January 2020 to December 2022.</p>
 

 


Implementation methodologies



<p>PEP supports researchers from developing countries through its unique programme, the grant plus model, that uses a &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; approach to provide local researchers with a comprehensive package of intensive training, continual mentoring, and international peer-review, designed to strengthen a range of skills related to the production and brokering of scientific evidence to inform policy from project design to publication and dissemination. PEP grantees are required to hold periodic consultations with policy stakeholders throughout the research cycle, including organizing high-level national policy conferences, which include the public and media. Through nine ongoing youth employment projects, PEP will contribute to Decent Jobs for Youth by providing access to information on youth employment policy as an evidence base. PEP will also provide support to promote the uptake of this evidence for policy action. The projects will result in a series of knowledge products, including working papers, policy papers, policy briefs and publications in peer-reviewed journals. PEP also publishes summaries of the projects&rsquo; findings for its news channels and website. At least 27 knowledge products will be produced that will contribute to the Decent Jobs for Youth Knowledge Facility. PEP will also support researchers&rsquo; participation in international conferences, which could include conferences of Decent Jobs for Youth, where they share their research findings with peers. A total of 49 youth employment stakeholders will be supported through technical assistance, capacity building and peer learning. It is estimated that at least 27 knowledge sharing events will be held as part of the projects.</p>

Description

                            Waves is an easy-to-use robot-advisor which allows you to generate a personal investment portfolio that creates tangible impact based on your values. By sharing with us the UN Sustainable Development Goals you wish to support we recommend funds that let you have a positive impact on what you care about. To us impact is about making a positive difference, rather than minimizing the negatives. For instance, you could see that your investment in Beyond Meat has saved the planet X tons of GHG emissions. We chase a positive return on investments and use modern portfolio theory to ensure sufficient diversification.This provides our customers with the emotional engagement of giving to charity coupled with the self interest of investing. In fact, research shows that sustainable investments tend to overperform typical market averages, a win-win situation!
                        
Expected impact

                            To reach the SDGs by 2030, the UN has calculated that we need to redirect investments of 7 trillion USD ANNUALLY. We see ourselves as a tool for achieving this massive transformation of our society at the industrial level that is necessary for our survival. In a longer perspective we see Waves as a tool for integrating values into finance and as a tool for truly democratic capitalism. Through informing investors of the impact of their investments we believe finance can become a tool for good.

Description/achievement of initiative

Namibia's Community Based Natural Resource Management Programme a combination of policy and legal reforms, which includes the granting of resource rights to local members of communal conservancies. A Compilation of Green Economy Policies, Programs, and Initiatives from establishment of conservancies - legally gazetted areas within the state's communal lands with manifested quotas and concession's - is among the most successful efforts by developing nations to decentralize natural resource management and simultaneously combat poverty. It is one of the largest-scale demonstrations of Community Based Natural Resource Management Programme (CBNRM) and the state-sanctioned empowerment of local communities.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



The analysis of the relevant formal and informal institutions showed that they tended to be â€¢ Dynamic / subject to change â€¢ Conflicting (i.e. legislation vs. traditional rules) â€¢ Unclear (especially about the role of the respective actors) and  â€¢ Not always effectively enforced. While CBNRM in Namibia appeared to be rather successful in devolving power from the national to the local level, the empowerment effects on the community level favoured local elites. In the two case study conservancies a â€œcentral power-groupâ€ tended to (more or less) seize benefits the manifested quotas and concessions and decision-making capacity. Community members and outside observers described the following problems: â€¢ A gap between conservancy staff / committee and the rest of the local population; local disparities were aggravated; â€¢ An unclear and potentially explosive role of the respective traditional authorities: relying on their land rights and traditional power position they acted either as motor or as stumbling block of conservancies; â€¢ A difficult relationship between NGOs and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, both following complementary development and conservation goals but competing for influence and resources; â€¢ Extremely high expectations from all sides that overburdened the projects and lead to frustration when not met.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Thinking of to start a business in Namibia, Namibia offers a unique set of advantages. The jewel in the desert is embarking on resource mobilization social protection system with digital good agenda internet services for woman and children at conservancy level community based natural resource management mitigates migration and trafficking, Namibia is one of the most competitive economies in Africa, it has robust macroeconomic environment combined with politically stable state often described as Africa's love to live and work.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


Community based natural resource management (CBNRM) creates an environment where people in communal areas can actively manage their ecosystems . Conservancies are democratically governed by communities through legal constitutions and elected representatives. The focus of this research is on the socio-political effects of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in Namibia. After the end of apartheid (1990) the new Namibian government chose a number of strategies to right the wrongs of the past, both economically and politically. One of them is Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM): Since 1996 communities in the communal areas (former â€œhomelandsâ€) have the right to form communal conservancies to jointly manage and protect their wildlife. This approach to conservation is expected to have ecological, economic and socio-political effects. The main aim of this research was to assess the effects, both material and immaterial, that CBNRM has on local resource use governance. To find out how and why CBNRM changed local governance, the institutional framework (â€œrules of the gameâ€) was analyzed in relation to actor-specific factors. To this end an interactive visualization tool (the â€œpower gameâ€) was developed. This tool allowed for the discussion of complex social livelihoods with interviewees from different and same backgrounds in terms of culture, education and experience.

ISO/PC 318 â€” Community scale resource-oriented sanitation treatment systems - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 29 March, 2018",['Goal 6'],"
Description

                            In 2010, the UN General Assembly called for international efforts to help countries to provide safe, clean, accessible, and affordable drinking water and sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 2.5 billion people have no access to safe, clean toilets, and 1 billion people are forced to defecate in the open. This leads to sickness and disease, including nearly 1,000 child deaths per day from water and sanitation-related diarrheal diseases.  New approaches for sustainable non-sewered sanitation systems are a practical solution. Adding to the challenge, WHO estimates 2 billion people use latrines that arenâ€™t properly drained, and 2 billion people use toilets that are connected to septic tanks that are not properly emptied. Without access to proper sewage treatment, pathogens from human waste make their way into the soil and water systems, contaminating food and water, and endangering human life. 

ISO/PC 318 contributes to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. ISO/PC 318 focuses on the development of an international standard that specifies performance and safety requirements of pre-fabricated community-scale resource oriented sanitation treatment systems supporting safe and sustainable fecal sludge management.  The fecal sludge treatment units serve approximately 1,000 to 100,000 people. The purpose of these faecal sludge treatment units is to safely process human waste and recover valuable resources such as water, energy and/or nutrients through economically sustainable faecal sludge treatment technologies in off-grid and non-sewered environments.  The standard will contain criteria for the functionality, usability, reliability, maintainability, and safety of faecal sludge treatment units that primarily treat faecal sludge, are able to operate in an off-grid and non-sewered environment, and are pre-fabricated.
                        
Expected impact

                            In general, international standards are strategic tools helping to reduce costs by minimizing trial and error development and facilitating free and fair global trade.  Sustainable Development Goal 6 states that everyone should have access to safe sanitation by 2030. Building conventional faecal treatment units is one solution to help achieve goal 6. However, there is no International Standard that contains commonly accepted criteria by which to measure their performance.

ISO 31800, a voluntary international standard, developed by experts around the globe, provides technical requirements and recommendation for manufacturers of faecal sludge treatment units, governments, regulators and operators (or service providers) to assure that the sanitation systems are safe, operable, reliable and environmentally friendly. In addition, ISO 31800 aims to facilitate the commercialization, scaling, and transfer of these faecal sludge treatment units into the market.

Overall, ISO 31800 helps ensure safety, performance, and sustainability for safer sanitation and greater public health â€”and supports people who lack access to adequate sanitation systems.

Songs of Adaptation - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 21 November 2019,"['Goal 4', '\n\n\nGoal 7', '\n\n\nGoal 8', '\n\n\nGoal 11', '\n\n\nGoal 13', '\n\n\nGoal 15', '\n\n\nGoal 16', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description/achievement of initiative

The Songs of Adaptation is a bioaccoustics research project with partnerships in Bolivia, Nepal, Maryland (U.S.),  and West Virginia (U.S.).  Through the collection and analysis of over a terabyte of data focusing on bird songs, vegetation, temperature, and human communities, communities will be better able to mitigate the effects of climate change.  The project is designed to bridge the gap between communities and the changing world around them, enabling them to make more informed decisions.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



The Songs of Adaptation project brings together several data-collecting instruments to monitor life across gradients of elevation or land use.  It fosters deeper understandings of ecosystem health at local levels.  Individual monitoring stations or a series of stations can be placed anywhere in the world; each tells its own story of change within the place.

The first major installations are in biodiversity hot-spots in remote areas of Nepal and Bolivia where instruments are placed at regular intervals along gradients to continually monitor bioaccoustics (life sounds), temperature, and humidity.  The data generated by the research stations are supplemented with vegetation surveys, wildlife cameras, GIS data, and historical data.  Smaller, individual stations can be anywhere. Future Generations has also begun monitoring at two educational centers in the United States on the Chesapeake Bay and Spruce Knob.   

Each station produces about 1 million minutes of audio data per year.  Technology through the Microsoft AI for Earth community and Azure  assist with cloud storage, machine learning, and big data analytics to enable the global team to analyze millions of minutes of audio. 

Deep learning algorithms identify and categorize sounds from species of focus, which are often birds.  Local experts help train and improve identification models and take the information back to communities.  This information helps communities to make data-driven decisions in how to respond to changes in the natural world.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


The Songs of Adaptation project is guided by a strong team of people who are trained in the SEED-SCALE methodology of Future Generations, which emphasizes the importance of engaging the community in all aspects of research and decision-making.   Two members of the team are currently students in the Future Generations University M.A. in Applied Community Development.  Another team member is an alumnus of the Master's degree.  Four of the team members are faculty in the M.A. program, teaching subjects such as Strategic Resource Mapping, Monitoring & Evaluation, Sustainable Communities, Introduction to Applied Community Change, and Going to Scale.  Other team members are scientists, experts in natural history and ornithology, data analysis, and computer science.  

Technology transfer occurs through partnerships both locally and abroad (especially within the countries of Nepal and Bolivia).  Consistent with the Future Generations University philosophy and methodology, efforts are made to make the research processes and results as accessible to local communities as possible.  Additionally, the project hopes to partner with schools to better disseminate the knowledge gained.  NorthBay Adventure Camp and Experience Learning are two partner organizations which benefit from the technology and knowledge advances of the Songs of Adaptation project.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The initiative is led by a Project Director, Naomi Bates, who has a PhD from Princeton University in Civil and Environmental Engineering.  She is assisted by Senior Scientists in the U.S., in Nepal, and in Bolivia, who are experts in ornithology, Himalayan flora and fauna, environmental conservation, and big data analytics.  Additionally, the team consists of support staff who specialize in data analysis, grant writing, equipment installation, and cross-cultural communication.  Weekly team meetings in person and via Zoom Video-Conferencing ensure timely progress toward goals and effective communication.  Twice-monthly University staff meetings ensure that the Songs of Adaptation team is in touch with the wider University community. 
Dr. Daniel Taylor, President of Future Generations University, oversees all aspects of the project, and Ms. Stephanie Hartman, Chief Operating Officer, has broad oversight of the financial aspects of the project.

The Ocean Conference  | Guidelines for Reducing Plastic Waste (GRP) & Global partnership ,Registered: 18 November 2019,"['goal 2""', 'goal 13', 'goal 17']","

- Scale and duration of the practice

Initiative of 'Guidlines for Reducing Plastic Waste (GRP) and 'Global Partnership' planned to be prgressed throughout 2018~2030.

-Socioeconomic Environment

Currently, the per capita consumption of plastic, including plastic bags in Korea is about 420 and 100 kilograms per year. It ranks first in the world in terms of the population ratio. Despite active plastic recycling campaigns in Korea, the rate of plastic which is recycled is under 9%. Therefore, if Korea creates a successful model on reducing plastic waste, it can be a best practice to be applied throughout the world.
In addition, over 70% of Korea border is surrounded by the ocean and is located in the pacific coast. Thus, if Korea takes more active action to improve the marine environment and establish a multinational partnership with corporations, it can strongly contribute to alleviating the marine pollution in the critical regions including Southeast Asia.

-Needs/Challenges/Opportunities

The capital of Korea, Seoul has confronted air pollution caused by fine dust. Additionally, Seoul exceeds the fine dust standard(25 per) rated by the World Health Organization(WHO). 1 stands for a millionth of one gram. During last year, in Seoul, the days that surpassed the WHO standards was 122 days. This means that the citizens of Seoul must live through severely polluted air once every three days. Such environmental issue cannot be solely dealt by the government, the National Assembly or the local government. All levels of stakeholders must take collaborative action, especially corporations must create partnerships to conduct effective carbon-reduction campaigns, and lead actions toward coming up with various technical solutions. 

Furthermore, ASD is establishing partnerships with the media, enterprises and the civil society, conducting diverse campaigns to resolve such environmental issues. Also, ASD runs the project with corporations to produce fine dust prevention masks and share the masks with citizens of the polluted area.

-Key operational lessons learned

Reducing plastic is critical issues that must to be resolved in a timely manner. However, these issues are one of the biggest challenges for global corporations as they must take the responsibility of the additional cost of materials and personnel expenses to approach and handle it. The initiatives of GRP can be a great role model as a response to our current environmental crisis.

Description/achievement of initiative

By 2021, SDG implementation in Venezuela is co-driven by an alliance of civil society, economy and academy through NGO initiatives appointing to achieve the 17 SDG 2030. Around of each one of the 17 ODS, communities will be formed to communicate on virtual platforms and forums (round tables), as well as promote and supported each other. A common action plan will be worked out in consensus, which includes coordination with politics, government and international development agencies. Finally, the SDG-Communities are connected and interacting with global communities sharing values of sustainable development, compromised with a safe world for future generations.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



There is a special focus on consensus building in communities around each one of the 17 SDGs, using the new austrian-german â€œSystemisches KONSENSIERENâ€. Therefore ways and methods will be look for and tried out, in order to detect and determine the most efficient and effective manners of collaboration, in harmony with the NGOs own goals and work. Second focus lies on financial sustainability of this activity; here different sources will be contacted in order to find out, how far we can receive financement and even redirect funds into certain NGOs of special importance and interest. Third focus lies on creation of processes and its documentation in order to offer guidance and permanency.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Right from beginning, Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer will be promoted, facilitated and enforced through strategic alliances with NGOs, economic associations and the academy.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


This is a Bottom-up activity. There is a team of three in general coordination, responsible for all planning, executing and administration, with assisting staff, if necessary. For each of the development goals, there will be one NGO or business association taking the lead of the â€œround tables of consensusâ€ with two co-leading organizations. Responsibility includes to unite groups of participants on local, regional and national level, if applies. Organise regular meetings throughout the year and maintain virtual section of web-site and other social media updated. Within of frame of yearly event FORUM SUSTAINABLE VENEZUELA - AGENDA ODS 2030 - 17 CONSENSUS, each of SDG-Communities will be given opportunity to present to general public, present cases from other countries, from all over the world and coordinate the yearly SDG-Community workshop. There indicators and achievement of activities will be presented, discussed and new consensus agreed for the next period. Throughout the year contact with national state SDG activities is fostered as well as with international development agencies.

Description

                            This action has three objectives: 1) strengthen the profile of trade unions as development actors on their own right in the eyes of governments and international organisations; 2)promote the central role that SDG 8 and the  Decent Work Agenda plays as a direct contributor to achieve other SDGs within the 2030 Agenda; and 3) the 2030 Agenda brings about radical changes in how the world is steered, hence the world of labour needs a new social contract that re-organises the role of economy and finances as means to contribute to addressing people's need and a sustainable way of living, working, producing and consuming. 
The project was first launched as a call to join an advocacy process to raise governments and their UN Ambassadors awareness of trade unions development cooperation and of SDGs centrality in the 2030 Agenda in order to have this reflected in the final SDG Summit statement of the Heads of State and Government who met in Sept. Following that activity, the action is now been deployed at local level in different countries to bridge national/local development and labour matters with the SDGs. Some punctual actions have been undertaken in Venezuela, Spain, Senegal, Morocco, Zambia, Finland and Argentina. However, the project is now in a phase of defining a broader amount of countries to pilot a more carry the action in a more focused and strategic way that would have a tripartite-scope, meaning that it would reach workers, employers and governments.  
The project is steered by the Development Cooperation Unit of the Economic and Social Policies Department of the ITUC.
                        
Expected impact

                            1. Decent work and SDG 8 are acknowledged by the social partners as central to achieve any truly sustainable development. Decent work is essential to achieve other goals.
2. Trade unions are acknowledged by the social partners as development actors and key contributors to devising and implementing development policies.
3. Trade unions are ackonwledged by the social-partners as vital partners to devise and implement successful transition plans that leave no one behind.
4. Social partners are open to shaping a new Social Contract that is based on the Decent Work Agenda and within which profit stops being a main objective but shift into a long-term sustainable approach to making business, employing people, producing, consuming and engaging with the communities where they are established.

Reducing Landfill Mass by securing successful long term deployment of unwanted office furniture otherwise bound for Landfill - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 13 November 2019,"['Goal 12', '\n\n\nGoal 13']","
Description/achievement of initiative

To reduce Landfill Mass by diverting materials bound for Landfill.

We currently save over 1000 tonnes of unwanted office furniture going to Landfill per annum and our aim is to increase this to 5000 tonnes per annum by 2025.

Nothing we divert is ever sent to Landfill.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



We work with Logistics companies who have tendered to clear and empty commercial buildings of all materials. Part of this tender is a cost for Landfill charges. In diverting the furniture to Mango Partnership we stop this additional Mass going to UK Landfill.

Mango Partnership work with Commercial Real Estate partners who offer their clients empty Commercial Real Estate for us to store diverted furniture, while we seek alternative uses for it. These clients of our Real Estate partners gain a financial benefit when we vacate against established business costs because of our work, which is why they agree to our occupation.

After this occupation, the furniture is taken to it's new permanent location or to Community Interest Companies to be gradually filtered back into usage by recycling responsibly and refurbishing where possible and necessary.  


Nothing is ever sent to Landfill.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Capacity building will be via growth implementation with increased penetration of the Commercial Real Estate Agents environment.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


Mango Partnership governs this initiative.

We liaise with our Commercial Real Estate Partners to source empty Commercial Real Estate. 

We liaise and manage our Logistics partners to ship the furniture to be stored in the empty Commercial Real Estate.

We liaise with Local Government to ensure our process meets current legislative demands.

We extract the furniture from the Real Estate to be reused in other locations, primarily through Community Interest Companies.

PRESERVING AYAM TELENG AS A MALAYSIAN CULTURE BY DESIGNING A CUTLERY PRODUCT - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 12 November 2019,"['Goal 10', '\n\n\nGoal 11', '\n\n\nGoal 12']","
Description/achievement of initiative

This initiative had been driven by the aim to preserve ayam teleng symbolism as a Malaysian culture by designing a cutlery product inspired by the ayam teleng. The objective of this initiative is to proclaim on how ayam teleng inspired the keris maker to form the haft of keris. To promote the ayam teleng symbolism in order to sustain the culture in Malaysia. To innovate the ayam teleng symbolisme into a custom-commercial product which is cutlery.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



To preserve this philosophy of ayam teleng, an initiative had been taken by designing a product using this philosophy. The implementation of this initiative is carried out by a various procedure starting with doing a research towards the culture existence and identified the input from the culture. This process is to understand what is the important message from the ayam teleng philosophy so that the information that had been dissect is from the message relatable to the product development.  Second, the approaching of design process will be used in order to adapt the concept of ayam teleng and turn it into other product. Function follow form process will be introduced from ideation of form, development of idea, finalise the design and mock up development. Third is the production process. From the final design, the design will be revise with technical input such as, the production capabilities and efficiency of production and after that the product will be produce.  Last process is acknowledging and promoting the product into the market. A cutlery product will be made using the ayam teleng culture and an experimental between culture and creative process will be made through this project. Cutlery is a product that related to food and etiquette and I choose cutlery because when ayam teleng is turning into a product, it become a keris which is the product that using hand in order to control the product. So cutlery is the nearest product to be developed and people using cutlery almost every day. With this type of behaviour, choosing cutlery is the best way to preserve the culture because the frequency of usage the volume in production. The expected outcome from this initiative is to provide the user an acknowledgement of Malaysian culture and how the philosophy of culture can be an inspiration to provide a product. From this project, exploring the potential culture and turn it into a commercial or gift product can sustain and preserve the culture from faded by the digital era.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer

CollatEd Lab - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 12 November 2019,['Goal 4'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

CollatEd is a data-driven education technology NGO, the first that uses open innovation as a means of pedagogy to propel Education Sustainable Development in the Global Action Programme network. By shaping youth into global citizens through solving our signature Challengesâ„¢ in exchange for solutions to corporate and institutional sustainability problems, CollatEd helps educators find practical applications of academic knowledge, all while strengthening studentsâ€™ academic prowess and working in global teams to facilitate the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Civil society, policymakers, students, and industry professionals from a variety of fields related to global problems are invited to create challenges based on their area of social impact for students. CollatEd writes its own software in a DIY format that automatically regroups and recommends ideas in its database in the areas of interest to accelerate the delivery of open and flexible education systems that enable equitable, relevant, lifelong learning opportunities in contribution to the SDGâ€™s. 

The product in the development process includes:
A sub-platform featuring our work on education policy and policy-oriented contributor submissions, with the goal of forming the worldâ€™s largest student-led education policy network. By responding to policy and simulating the impact, either through ideas crossed over from Challenges, students form a productive dialogue that becomes valuable feedback for centralized decision-making bodies.

Once students complete their Innovator Profile and select a Challenge, they join a team automatically selected based on matching of profiles. The chat space is connected to a desktop idea-design toolbox to inspire their projects. The desktop supports an experimental mode of music-remixing-inspired innovation. It takes multidimensional features of existing ideas initialized to examples of innovation. Machine learning incorporates past projects contributors uploaded over time, so that users can opt to start the innovation from remix results or from blank. After submission and evaluation, students can decide what to do with their accomplishment, in collaboration with the contributor if listed as such, via a page with interactive guides for entrepreneurship or portfolio or social activism. If used in a classroom, teachers can designate the action that want to take. Meanwhile, CollatEd prepares these results into reports that inform the UNESCO Global Action Programmeâ€™s work.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


The UN Partnership network is central to CollatEd. The UN Sustainable Development Goal #4 demands quality education, which CollatEd tackles by changing how specific communities benefit from the Education Sustainable Development (ESD). Furthermore, CollatEd itself seeks to expand formally and functionally the UNESCO Youth Forum.CollatEd identifies broadly SDG, ESD, and GCED coalitions and stakeholders as the contributor for Challenges. But applied to the student population, Challengesâ„¢ is the first method of its kind to drive innovation and promote global citizenship among youth, provided a stable content flow. Where education is well-established, creating such a system of open innovation presents a clear parallel to the college-career framework that most schools in the Anglosphere has adopted. Shifting the mindset of school boards creates an important new education standard of collaborating with learners around the world. It also draws a paradigmatic focus to Educational Sustainable Development in particular communities, allowing students to impact their surroundings while pursuing their growth. CollatEdâ€™s advancement of the Right to Innovate, in turn, has a systemic impact on developing societies and economies. The Challengesâ„¢ is designed for the final purpose of research benefitting the UNESCO and World Bank education accessibility initiatives. More than the universal access of digital materials, we seek an immediate idea-to-impact transference so that education is more widely accepted and impactful in communities. Also, due to the large population and understaffed nature of public schools, the teacher-to-student ratio is very low. The California Board of Education has recognized this problem and has endorsed CollatEd to begin in its schools. As an easy-to-install application, CollatEd divides the burden of block investments into manageable pieces for each student to download onto their own devices. This allows for schools to divert funding to areas important for the studentsâ€™ wellbeing during attendance. In addition, CollatEd works in conjunction with existing systems, by opening direct links from Learning Management Systems to satisfy textbook learning objectives. These LMS incorporations funnel directly into broader change in American education standards: for student research in the social sciences and humanities, we selected the US Census Bureauâ€™s Statistics in Schools (SIS) reference standards in the five priority areas highly impactful to civilizations and sustainability: Geography, History, Language, Statistics, and Sociology. For STEM applications, we selected five priority areas in general Mathematics, Engineering, Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems, and Human Sustainability, based on the Next Generation Science Standards.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


This initiative is governed in two ways. Firstly, our seven member international Youth Executive Team carry out all the functions of CollatEd. We are in the process of forming a Global Advisory Board of adult members who are not only world-renowned global leaders, but also have experience in the classroom. Secondly, our endorsing agencies assist in the application of our model. Each agencies role can be summarized as follows: 

UNESCO: this organization serves a crucial role in that its representatives submit Challengesâ„¢ for our student innovators to research. However, these Challengesâ„¢ are more focused on social science topics to ensure we are undertaking an interdisciplinary approach to addressing a particular SDG. 

The World Bank: this entity provides data insights on our data-driven education model to further our education accessibility initiatives in developing countries. Currently, we are building out an AI-driven software for curriculum distribution in K-12 schools and universities!  

The African Union: we are in the process of finalizing a continental partnership that is purely for impact, that is, we distribute our software to this party and they distribute within the countries that the Union operates in. In the coming weeks, this partnership will become more concrete.  

European Commission/The United Nations Development Programme: these organizations serve a similar function to the African Union in that our software is distributed to any countries that interact with the EC's UNDP's global network.  

Collectively, our partners serve a vital role but we also ensure that the work CollatEd does is mutually beneficial. Indeed, after a student innovator submits their research projects, we prepare these results into reports that inform the UNESCO Global Action Programmeâ€™s work. Foreign Education Ministries, policy-makers, and government officials of higher-level education in countries connected with our partners help facilitate communication to the institutions who can support our iWorld Policy Lab. This is where our goal of becoming the largest student-led educational policy program comes into play. We believe that by establishing this multi-sectoral, active feedback loop between our partners, we seek to streamline ideas between solutions for sustainable policy-making and decentralizing law-making bodies by making their ideas accessible to inform policy. We are not merely a think-tank because all research that is submitted by our student innovators can take a variety of roles in their application to solving global issues!

Description

                            The four cycle Action Research project;-
1. Relevance;-  Because  Poverty in Nigeria is over 60%.  Nigeria is ranked a dismal 150 out of 156 countries based on the SDG index assessed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) for the United Nations SDG Partnership program, there is a need to re-educate the whole populace as fast as possible in order to achieve the following;
a) Build the capacity of individuals and families meet their SDG rights within their given environment.
b) Establish a network of agents that will be the core educations and mentors for the homes schools and social organizations.
c) Develop a multi-purpose curriculum that will be relevant both to the wide range of learners to which it will be applied.
d) Provide support systems and pilot demonstration centers for equipping and enabling the agents and mentor educators succeed in their mission to help all around them attain the SDGs as a right.
2. Aims & Objectives;-The aim of this ABM and action research study project is as follows; a) to train mentors /educators as agent of ESDR- Education for Sustainable Development Rights and equip them with the skills to train their chosen sectors in  sustainable living using principles of ESDR, Educational technology and information technology to train and mentor students/ mentees.  b) To operate the training using a network connection of emails, IT programs such as Whatsapp, UNESCO ESDR micro demonstration centers and Seminars to conclude the training and monitoring. c) To ultimately improve on the attainment of the SDG Justice and sustainable living of the immediate community and reduction on the level poverty, illiteracy and unsustainable living in the community  
3.  Methods;- This study project is a four cycle action research project using the students as agents and mentors in training.  Most of the training is online using the email and programs like the Whatsapp program. The study is done in collaboration with the CODSACOE- Committee of Deans of Student Affairs of Colleges of Education at the NCCE- National Commission of Colleges of Education. The four major partners are as follows;- 1) CODSACOE; - Government regulator - 2) FLSOYC- First Lady's Save Our Youths Campaign;- NGO;  3) Kamche CHOGM College;- Education Consultants;-  4) Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Owerri;- Pilot Demonstration Center;   -5) NAPPS - National Association of  Proprietors of Private Schools, Imo state- pilot study.   
The project methodology consists of four Action Research Cycles namely; - - a) Cycle 1- Develop a 15week general  curriculum that will cover 14 Topical areas that deal with ESDR. with a 5week teaching experience guideline making it a total of  twenty weeks.
b) Cycle 2- To train the Professional leadership Agent Based Models using emails and Whatsapp for sending training manuals and discussion of issues.
c) Cycle 3- Hold a three day seminar with assessment and exhibition for the agents with Certification for successful candidates only
d) Cycle 4- Six months and one year post training follow-up assessment of lifestyle of  the agents mentees at the micro demonstration centers..
                        
Expected impact

                            . Expected Results;-  Some of the anticipated results are; i)Development of a working curriculum on the mini professional leadership diploma on ESDR;  ii) Certification of the agents as trained UNESCO ABM educator / ESDR mentor ;  iii) Improvement in the lifestyle of the agents mentees and students; iv) Development of a micro demonstration and support service center;  v) A better response to the attainment of the SDGs at the demonstration centers by the students/mentees. Significant Change in the poverty Justice level of the intervention population;  Ability of both the mentors and mentees to meet their needs and rights within their given environment.
5. Conclusions;- From this action research study,  it is therefore concluded as follows;- i) that literacy alone does not make for sustainable living.  Applied  and practically oriented sustainable development education practices are required to ensure that the community is successfully meeting its needs and rights within the given environment. Agent based ESDR diploma is therefore a valuable tool ensuring that communities are mentored into cultivating a sustainable life.

Description

                            A Waste Transfer Centre is a place for waste separation whereby people from the Community will come with their waste for separation after separation is done the Recycle companies will come and buy the recycle materials and that money is used for buying incoming products from the Community. Products will be weighed and paid according to their weights.  Waste will no longer be waste but a source of income and livelihood to the community. It also advocates for the sensitization of residents including women and youths of Dzivarasekwa,  to be responsible citizens to their environment. It addresses the emerging need to inform and educate people on the importance of living in a clean environment and do away with land pollution in line with Sustainable Development Goals. The project is supposed to pay more attention to the land pollution, waste management and recycling issue in this area. A series of initiatives will be described and proposed to allow for the dissemination of this information and taking urgent action to maintain a healthy environment but making money through waste in the process. The Project covers SDGs 5,6, 8, 11 and 13.
                        
Expected impact

                            The centre had fully employed 8 Anti Litter Monitors and 2 security guards from the local community . Members from the community are now fully engaging themselves in protecting the environment. This is so because the 10 anti litter monitors from the community are carrying out campaigns in their neighbourhoods pertaining the transfer center as this is helping them a lot since most are now participating in creating a safe and sustainable environment which is the current initiative. More so, the people in the community also came up with an idea on creating another transfer center as this one is central. Hence they need it to be decentralized to all centers in Dzivareskwa as it is a big community. More people are now interested in collecting litter from the dumpsite and are bringing it to the centre. This in a way is protecting the environment as a few litter is being seen in the community since the establishment of the waste transfer centre.

Implementation methodologies



CDM METHODOLGY - UNFCCC

CDM AM0091 Methodology - Project activities implementing energy efficiency measures and/or fuel switching in new and existing building units (residential, commercial, and/or institutional building units). Examples of the measures include efficient appliances, efficient thermal envelope, efficient lighting systems, efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, passive solar design, optimal shading, building energy management systems (BEMS), and intelligent energy metering.

CDM ACM0022 Methodology -  The project involves one or a combination of the following waste treatment options: Composting process in aerobic conditions; Gasification to produce syngas and its use; Anaerobic digestion with biogas collection and flaring and/or its use (this includes processing and upgrading biogas and then distribution of it via a natural gas distribution grid),  Treatment of wastewater in combination with solid waste, by co-composting or in an anaerobic digester.


CDM ACM0012 Methodology - Energy from waste heat, waste gas or waste pressure in an existing  by installation of a new power and/or heat and/or mechanical energy generation equipment, or by installation of a more efficient electricity generation equipment than already existing, or by upgrade of existing equipment but with better efficiency of recovery.

CDM AMS-3 AE Methodology - Installation of energy efficiency and optional renewable power generation measures in new, grid-connected residential buildings

ESCO Services

An Energy Service Company (ESCO) is â€œa company that provides energy-efficiency related servicesâ€. ESCO enters into a performance contract with a client, guaranteeing a certain amount of energy saving which will pay back for the project cost and ESCO service. ESCO is expected to play crucial role in delivering improved energy efficiency and contributing to potentially substantial energy savings in all sectors including Industrial, Commercial, Agricultural, Residential, etc. This would result in reduction of Greenhouse gas emission, promote clean energy and foster economic growth by reducing the power demand supply gaps.

Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The World Energy Council - THE whole-systems global energy community lies at the heart of the Council, connecting over 3,000 energy organisations and Member Committees in nearly 100 countries. Our community platform of energy leaders and experts drive impact and help navigate the broad and fast-moving landscape of energy transition.

THE  national Member Committees lead the energy dialogue at local and regional levels, enabling debate between government, the business community and other stakeholders. They ensure that knowledge, expertise and insights are shared within their communities and play their part in the global effort to transition to a more sustainable energy system. 

Healthy energy systems are secure, equitable and environmentally sustainable, showing a carefully managed balanced Trilemma between the three dimensions. Maintaining this balance in context of rapid transition to decentralised, decarbonised, and digital systems is challenging with the risk of passiveâ€¯trade-offs between equally critical priorities.  
Energy leaders need to manage the competing demands of the energy trilemma. The World Energy Council Energy Trilemma Index is an annual measurement of national energy system performances.

Improve connectivity and  biodiversity conservation by strengthening local institutions and organizations in the Amazon region to ensure comprehensive low carbon management and peace building. - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 01 February, 2018","['Goal 1', '\n\n\nGoal 13', '\n\n\nGoal 15', '\n\n\nGoal 16']","
Description

                            The Colombian Amazonian forest represents 6.5 percent of the biomeâ€™s rainforest and 42 percent of the countryâ€™s land mass. Deforestation (at an annual rate of 82,883 ha/year) is threatening the regionâ€™s biodiversity, its capacity to act as storage of biomass and organic carbon in soil, helping to mitigate the emissions of GHG, and the provision of environmental services for the 1.2 million people living in this region. With the current rates of deforestation, complete ecosystem connectivity between the Andes and the Amazon forests will be lost by 2030.

In 2013, the GoC presented its VisiÃ³n AmazonÃ­a, promoting a low-carbon development model and the goal of net-zero deforestation by the year 2020. In its vision, the GoC recognizes that the Amazon â€œcannot simply be a large protected area, but ought also to provide additional alternatives for development and integration into the global economy for its population, as well as wealth and prosperity for the country at large.â€ The Colombian Amazon project that is part of the Amazon Sustainable Landscape Program consists of two interrelated components: 1) Forest conservation and sustainability in the heart of the Colombian Amazon (implemented by the WB); 2) Connectivity and Biodiversity Conservation in the Colombian Amazon (implemented by the UNDP).
                        
Expected impact

                            People benefit from strengthening livelihoods through solutions for natural resource management, ecosystem services, chemicals and waste.

"Ensure resilience at the household level in 3 of the most vulnerable regions of La Mojana, through the promotion of adaptive infrastructure and the creation of family orchards. - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform","Start: 01 October, 2017","['Goal 1', '\n\n\nGoal 6', '\n\n\nGoal 13', '\n\n\nGoal 15']","
Description

                            The region of La Mojana is an area located in the Colombian Caribbean, which covers 11 municipalities in the departments of Sucre, BolÃ­var, CÃ³rdoba and Antioquia. La Mojana is one of the most complex deltas in the world, with a great ecosystem richness, its system collects the waters of the three main rivers of the Andean area of â€‹â€‹the country (Magdalena River, Cauca River and San Jorge River) and is composed of multiple marshes, pipes, meanders, zapales, and flood forests. This region is inhabited by about 405,625 people, of which 83.8% is poor and with livelihoods strongly vulnerable to changes in climate and water dynamics in the area. Additionally, the armed conflict in the region has negatively impacted local governance and delayed the development of communities.

One of the most critical problems of La Mojana is the access by the (mainly rural) communities to drinking water, in fact, 49% of the population does not have access. In a scenario without intervention, an aggravated situation is anticipated in terms of water availability due to the projected reduction in rainfall for the region, exacerbated by more intense and frequent extreme events (floods and droughts) that would not only affect the supply in terms of quantity but in quality, since in periods of extreme flooding the waters infiltrate the underground wells contaminating the water consumed by the population. This situation has direct impacts on people's lives, their health, their economy and their form of development. Additionally, the productive activities that sustain the region's economy end up making its inhabitants more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability.
                        
Expected impact

                            Greater understanding and systematization of knowledge about the impacts of climate change on water management in the region.

Establishment of climate-adapted water supply infrastructure for the most vulnerable communities in La Mojana, consisting of water harvesting solutions at family level for dispersed rural areas (for 4,878 families), water harvesting solutions at community level for rural areas nucleated (for 8,560 families), adaptation of the existing infrastructure of rural micro-aqueducts to make it less vulnerable to changes in the climate and extreme weather events (96 micro-aqueducts).

Recovery of the adaptive capacity of natural ecosystems and those that support the livelihoods of communities, which will be done through the restoration of wetland landscapes on 41,532 hectares.

Early warning systems adapted to climate change.

Water-resistant agroecosystems to improve rural livelihoods. Research activities will be carried out on crops of climate-adapted varieties, there will be a rural extension program that will benefit more than 17,000 local producers, and family gardens adapted for 4,878 families that make up the dispersed rurality of La Mojana will be installed.

THE PHILIPPINE LEARNING COMMONS AT NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KAOHSIUNG (PLC@NUK) - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 25 October 2019,"['Goal 4', '\n\n\nGoal 8', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description/achievement of initiative

The objective of the Philippine Learning Commons at National University of Kaohsiung (PLC@NUK) is to raise international migrant workersâ€™ right by life-long learning. Specifically, PLC@NUK promotes the Filipino migrant workersâ€™ human capital and social capital when they work in Taiwan. Human capital and social capital, as key factors of productivity, are the important sources of competitive advantage of companies and nations. PLC@NUK builds a platform by introducing Taiwanese culture, language and other related courses and developing long-distance learning courses to enhance the Filipino migrant workersâ€™ human capital and social capital in Taiwan.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



PLC@NUK instructs Filipino migrant workers regarding Taiwanese culture and language, and Taiwanese industrial and social development through two-year implementation activities. PLC@NUK hosts extension courses, educational activities, and workshops and establishes long-distance education platforms for the Filipino migrant workers. By delivering Taiwanese culture and language training courses, PLC@NUK helps them enhance human capital and social capital. Through those courses, workshops, and other related activities, we hope to achieve UN SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).

The first year
1.	UPOU and National University of Kaohsiung Teaching Alliance

PLC@NUK designs status tracking survey by measuring the learning effectiveness to justify the contents of these extension education activities/ workshops.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


1. UPOU and National University of Kaohsiung Teaching Alliance:
PLC@NUK is expected to serve as an ""open university"", which is promoted by the Ministry of Education, into the New Southbound Policy of Taiwan. Through implementing PLC@NUK, the Filipino migrant workers can easily transfer their qualifications to take the on-line courses in the platform of the University of Philippine Open University (UPOU). NUK offers non-degree courses to the Filipino migrant workers about Taiwan culture, languages and second specialty skills, to improve their abilities and get along with Taiwanâ€™s enterprises and society more easily.

2. Hosting extension education activities and workshops:
PLC@NUK provides the facilities and classrooms to host extension education activities and workshops like Taiwanese culture and language, basic coffee latte art, scented herbal handmade soap, aerobic activities and health massage workshops and so on, to expand the second specialty knowledge and capacity-building of the Filipino migrant workersâ€™ capability. For example, they can use these knowledge and capacity-building to start their business when they back home a few years later. 

3. Establishing long-distance education platforms for Filipino migrant workers:
Due to the facts of work shifts among the Filipino migrant workers, it is impossible to study in the same way as the general college students. Therefore, we provide long-distance learning platforms (hardware and software) for the migrant workers. Through the uses of mobile devices (such as phones or tablets, etc.), it is free to carry out online learning through PLC@NUK.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


1.	In accordance with Taiwanâ€™s government industrial development policy, National University of Kaohsiung (NUK) assists to upgrade and transform traditional industries and train professionals in technology and management.

Organizational learning and entrepreneurs empowerment in Clermont-Ferrand (Singes Bleus) - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 22 October 2019,['Goal 8'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

The initiative aims to create a learning organization of entrepreneurs who want to create their business. We encourage exchanges between members with modern techniques of desgin thinking and agile and collaborative management. Far from the standards of start-ups that raise millions, we act for the dynamism of our local eco-system and the success of each one.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



There are several learning levers for our organization. The first is to promote inter-personal exchanges, for which we have set up a portfolio of skills that everyone can consult online. A mentoring system has been set up to promote free skills training. The support function is responsible for facilitating exchanges and re-launching people who are registered in this local mentoring program.
4 times a year we organize a summary of the transactions that have been made and the different types of partners propose ways to improve these exchanges.
These exchanges are then stored in our online searchable database where we also store the knowledge our members need.
Thereafter we organize training sessions and conferences that our members provide in order to finish the knowledge transmission loop.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


Our members carry the initiative locally by word of mouth, the goal being to reach the maximum of freelancers and entrepreneurs in our city. We do not sign contracts and are open to any partnerships of structures already existing in our city. The goal is to strengthen the transmission of knowledge by implementing best knwoledge transfer practices that exist but are not being implemented at the moment. There are silos between the different groups that exist and our goal is to break these silos. Our learning platform is open to everyone and we are looking for people from different eco-systems to become ambassadors.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


Our governance is democratic and for that reason we are structured in association. The members are equal, regardless of the capital invested in the company. We set up a dues system to help entrepreneurs who have less turnover. Governance helps in the technical aspects (internet, administrative and financial). Thus the barriers are lifted to allow everyone to succeed in entrepreneurship. We meet 4 times a year for open meetings that bring together technical support members, contributors and their clients. Customers are also actors in our cooperative! We organize trainings that help them better understand their needs and the effort that everyone must provide.

Ensuring climate resilient water supplies in the Comoros Islands - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 22 October 2019,['Goal 13'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

The country is highly vulnerable to climate effects such as cyclonees, erosion, flash floods and droughts. Rising temperatures will also reduce water availability and cause saline intrusion from rising sea levels. This project will strengthen the national governance of water by intergrating climate change into the country&#39;s new water code. This will include integrating climate information into revised water regislation reforms and upgrading tariff reforms to include the additional costs of reducing climate risks. Enhanced climate-resilient water infrastructure will incorporate expanded water storage tanks to store more water through longer dry periods.

India plans to produce 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022 - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 01 January, 2016","['Goal 7', '\n\n\nGoal 13']","
Description

                            The Government of India  has set a target of installing of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022, which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from bio-power and 5 GW from small hydro-power.

The Ministry of Urban Development had requested all States & UTs, in 2014 to issue necessary directives to all State Government Departments for using rooftop of buildings under their control for solar power generation on mandatory basis and also to local bodies under their jurisdiction to incorporate the similar provision in their building bye-laws so that installation of Roof Top Systems (RTS) on rooftops of all types of buildings in their jurisdiction may become mandatory. Further, the Ministry of Urban Development also issued Model Building Bye-Laws, 2016, in which suitable provisions for installation of RTS on buildings have been incorporated. Four States/UTs viz. Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have already issued mandatory notifications for installation of RTS in different categories of buildings.

The Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of solar power projects is less than thermal, hydro, nuclear, wind and bio-mass power projects. The Government has launched several schemes for promotion and development of renewable energy including solar energy in the country from time to time.   The Government is promoting development of solar energy in the country by providing various fiscal and promotional incentives such as accelerated depreciation, waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses, financing solar rooftop systems as part of home loan, and permitting Foreign Direct Investment up to 100 per cent under the automatic route.
                        
Expected impact

                            India has been targeting to add large-scale conventional power capacities, as alternatives were very costly. Now, however, with solar and wind power becoming commercially viable in comparison to marginal mainstream sources (particularly imported coal, and nuclear based generation), there are additional choices available to policymakers concerned with the technical, economic, and environmental characteristics of a future power system that can keep pace with the economic growth. In view of the above, Indiaâ€™s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) aims to base 40% of the total installed power generation capacity on non-fossil fuel resources by 2030 with international support on technology transfer and financing. This includes Government of Indiaâ€™s ambitious target of achieving 175GW of RE by the year 2022 that marks 75 years of our independence.

Within this project there are provisions for intricate collaboration among key educational institutions that have contributed to the development of the water sector of Barbados. With these institutions working together, this is the BWA, University of West Indies, Cave Hill Campus (UWI-CHC) and University of South Florida (USF), it is anticipated that a sharing platform will be developed that will incubate the generation of novel ideas in the effort to combat the impact of climate change and also to propel the discussion on climate change adaptation and mitigation.
This project proposes to gather the relevant human resources from these institutions and form a team of scientists and engineers to drive the in-depth operational research to build capacity. This is to aim to realize innovative measures to ensure that the knowledge gaps, (with respect to integrated energy-water management that reduces impact of Climate Change in the Caribbean region), that are discovered can be filled though south-to-south learning initiatives. It is advantageous in some aspect that Barbados has the highest Human Development Index in the Caribbean. In this manner, Barbados can serve as a brilliant example to be a model for south-to-south cooperation for the rest of the Caribbean in these water sector initiatives. In this regard, the dissemination of knowledge would not only be at the employee level with practical and theoretical training; but must also ensure that the various stakeholders are involved in the knowledge strengthening. In this manner it is only then possible to ensure that there is a behavioral change that this project also seeks to have as an impact on the local community of Barbados.
The proposed capacity building component will train persons in energy efficiency, water loss reduction, resilience response programme, and rainwater harvesting. Additionally, it will organize education/outreach activities and deliver via seminars and workshops to communities and government agencies as well as foster research for use in informing development. Of these initiatives it is important that the documentation of the project progress be a resource that everyone who is interest can access due to the valuable information that can be contained in the document.

Description

                            AgrolÃ­bano has a Social Investment Policy aligned to the SDGs, which is implemented by the AgrolÃ­bano Foundation. Until July 2018, the impact recorded is reflected in 4 indicators: Reduction of the population index in extreme poverty (by income) from 49.3% in 2013 to 45% in 2018. Decrease in the global malnutrition rate in children under 3 years of age. 14.7% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2018. Reduction of the infant mortality rate from 29 / 1000nv in 2013 to 13 / 1000nv in 2018. Reduction of illiteracy by 60%, decreasing from 12% in 2013 to 4.8% in 2018. 
With the vision of implementing a business model of social investment that promotes well-being to those left behind, we focus our efforts on actions to reduce multidimensional poverty. Thus, in 2018 we conducted a study of the IPM - Multidimensional Poverty Index in 100% of the neighboring communities, resulting in 0.43, with an incidence of 89% and an intensity of 48.09%. We have applied the analysis of the deprivations found in the study to the strategic plan that from 2019 to 2023 will allow us to contribute to the sustainable human development of the population, through a comprehensive approach to the dimensions related to multidimensional poverty in the rural area of the southern zone of Honduras.
This plan is composed of 6 programs, which according to dimension are detailed as follows:
Dimension: standard of living 
â€¢	Program: Strengthening citizen participation for peace and development Action: 1- Strengthening leadership in communities 2- Accompaniment for the development and management of Community Development Plans with a comprehensive approach and integrated management
â€¢	Program: Local economic development: 1- Strengthening of Rural Savings and Credit Funds 2- Promotion of entrepreneurship 3- Strengthening of agricultural production as an income-generating economic activity
Dimension: Health
â€¢	Program: Comprehensive early childhood care Action: 1- Child Nutrition 2- Initial education - early stimulation 3- Pre-basic education
â€¢	Program: Healthy families Action: 1- Promotion of sexual health and reproductive health 2- Healthy housing - water and sanitation 3- Food security and healthy lifestyles 4- Health committees - community participation 5- Improved attention to health problems unattended health
Dimension: Education 
â€¢	Program: Five Star Schools Action: 1- Pedagogical and organizational strengthening 2- Promotion of a Culture of Peace through art, culture and sport 3- School health 4- School environmental responsibility 5- Infrastructure improvement.
â€¢	Program: Access to education for groups in social exclusion. Action: 1- Literacy 2- Non-formal education alternatives to improve coverage of basic education.
To measure the results of the programs there is a monitoring system based on 17 indicators that are measured annually, some of these indicators reflect the change observed in the deprivations linked to multidimensional poverty.

Expected impact

                            We hope that the actions contribute to reducing the IPM - Multidimensional Poverty Index, from 0.43 which is currently, to less than 0.40 in the year 2023. To verify, we commit ourselves to periodically measure the IPM and that its results guide us to the necessary adjustments to ensure that these programs contribute to the SDG targets by 2030 in Honduras.

Description

                            More than five billion people around the world are denied meaningful access to justice. They are driven from their land, denied basic services, and intimidated by violence. Namati and members of the Global Legal Empowerment Network will advance justice by equipping people to understand, use, and shape the laws that affect them.

Legal empowerment efforts are often carried out by community paralegals, who go by many names, including barefoot lawyers or community legal workers. They are trained in law and policy and in skills like mediation, organizing, and advocacy. They help people to seek concrete solutions to instances of injustice, engaging formal and traditional institutions alike. 

Community paralegals are essential to closing the global justice gap. They have proven that they can help communities to access justice, even when systems are broken. With the law on their side, people are able to thrive, seek peaceful solutions, protect the lands and resources they depend on, and hold their governments to account. 

The Global Legal Empowerment Network will strengthen and connect community paralegals, and the organizations that deploy them, around the world. We will build spaces for them to meet and collaborate online and in-person. We will host events and activities that help them learn from each other. We will maintain a library of useful resources. We will collectively advocate  to secure support and sustainable funding for the field. 

Namati will also work in close partnership with network members to take on three urgent issues - health justice, land and environmental justice, and citizenship justice - in six countries: Kenya, India, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, and the United States. 

Together with the communities we serve, we will strive to translate the lessons from our grassroots experience into positive, large-scale changes to laws and systems. We will share everything we learn from our grassroots work with our wider community. 

By unlocking the potential of community paralegals who provide essential legal support to communities, we will help to make justice a reality for the billions who are being left behind.
                        
Expected impact

                            Namati, the members of our network, and the communities we serve will grow the Global Legal Empowerment Network into a powerful movement for justice. We will also aim to achieve transformative impact in at least six countries.

The Global Legal Empowerment Network will engage thousands of members in activities that advance the field of legal empowerment, including collaborative learning, programming, research, community-building, and advocacy. We will support hundreds of grassroots organizations with meaningfully deepening the impact, sustainability, or quality of their legal empowerment work. We will transform the policy environment for legal empowerment. In particular, we will work to increase financing and protection for justice defenders at national, regional and global levels. 

Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone, by supporting communities in protecting their customary land rights, we will significantly reduce environmental and social harm from mining, agricultural, or development projects. We will change policy nationwide so that people who depend on the land have a meaningful voice in what happens to it. In Kenya, where paralegals are helping communities to secure IDs, we will work to end discrimination in the administration of identity documents. We will also bring a historic community land law to life by helping communities to secure over a million hectares of land and persuading county governments to implement the law. In Mozambique, where paralegals are helping people to understand health policy and to take action to address failures to comply, we will significantly reduce violations and democratize health governance nationwide though the empowerment of village health committees. In India, we will empower communities to use the law to find remedies when industrial projects violate environmental regulations, as well as to demand a more effective and participatory regulatory framework. In Myanmar, community paralegals support farmers to navigate complex administrative processes for regaining access to land that was seized during military rule. There, we will strive to replace a top-down, repressive system of land governance with one that respects the experience and voice of those who depend directly on the land.

The Positive Curriculum is a set of educational resources that implement the lessons of kindness and peace in the core curriculum of the schools in subjects such as math, English, reading, and history; the Positive Curriculum also has resources for when students are in the lunch room, on the bus, or walking through the hallways in the form of posters and school exercises. The Curriculum is taught through the blending of the existing school curriculum in order to promote a seamless anti-bullying culture as well as strengthen relationships with schools and students.


The RISE Anti-Bullying Initiative has created The Positive Curriculum and will be overseeing the international implementation of it through its African and Australian partners as well as other stakeholders that will be joining. The promotion of the Curriculum will be monitored through the research of vulnerable areas, which are also known as regional areas that have issues with bullying in schools, which are recognized through international data that is in the public knowledge database. Each partner will have its own mechanism for ensuring the implementation of the Curriculum through their own stakeholder networks and relationships with governments. Every other week, the stakeholders will be meeting with The RISE Anti-Bullying Initiative to report back on their findings as well identify and monitor vulnerable areas that have a higher rate of bullying in their schools and amongst their youth. Each stakeholder will also be responsible for educating their local and regional communities on the anti-bullying message and promoting the international PSA that will air in their respective communities.

Sustainable and Climate Resilient Connectivity for Nauru - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 16 October 2019,['Goal 9'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

Nauru depends significantly on its port for supplies of food, energy and most other essentials. Constructing a climate-resilient port that can operate year-round will provide the basis for regional and international maritime transport. The rehabilitation and climate-proofing of the existing infrastructure will be combined with supporting reforms of the Nauru Port Authority to assure long-term viability of the investment. The upgraded port infrastructure will feature a channel for oceangoing ships, a wharf with a turning berth, a breakwater to shelter the wharf and berth from waves, and other facilities.

Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


This project will also help reform port governance and management and capacity building of Nauru Port Authority (NPA) to ensure financial, economic, and institutional sustainability. The State Own Enterprise (SOE) model is recommended as the appropriate management model for NPA. This recommendation was concluded upon detailed assessment of other potential options including contracting port management and operations to a specialist private sector company and possible public private partnership (PPP). The primary issue is the ability of the NPA to generate sufficient revenue for the operations and lack of necessary skills of the NPA workforce in operating port activities efficiently. The effect of this is it is unlikely that any contracting or PPP would work effectively. However, the proposed reforms and new port facilities will attract new business opportunities for NPA and the PPP option can be considered consequently possibly after 3-5 years upon establishing new port facilities.
The project will support NPA to implement reforms for at least 5 years. The reforms and capacity building of NPA are contingent for successful port management, operations and sustainability of the new assets acquired under the project. Under ongoing project preparatory works, a detailed study concluded that (i) NPA need to be restructured as a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) against current government&#39;s department type management, (ii) establish and implement a cost recovery level tariff structure and regulations, (iii) establish new IT based accounting, financial, human resource and training, operation and asset management system and procedures, and (iv) capacity building of port authority staff through on-the job and specific training. The government has agreed to institute necessary legislative approvals for transforming NPA into a SOE, revision to tariff structure, and introduce or revise port related regulations. It is planned that legislative and regularity amendments and new organization structure, procedures and practices can be established by mid-2018. By the time the new port assets will be completed by end 2019, the NPA will be expected to substantially function as a credible organization compliant to international standards especially the requirements of international maritime organization (ISPS Code) and UN maritime conventions (UNCLOS) which government is signatory to.

Tina River Hydropower Development Project - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 16 October 2019,['Goal 7'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

The Solomon Islands seeks to greatly increase access to reliable electricity supply, whilst also increasing the use of renewable energy to 50% by 2020. The Tina River Hydropower Development Project (TRHDP) will respond to these goals with a 15MW installation providing 65% of electricity demand for the capital Honiara by the online date of 2022. TRHDP will provide the Solomon Islands with reservoir capacity, giving flexibility to the power system to enable higher penetration of PV power without the need for large and expensive energy storage or diesel generators.
 

 


Implementation methodologies


Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


The Project is the first utility-scale power plant in the Solomon Islands to be developed on a BOOT arrangement. IDA, with financial support from the Government of Australia, has been supporting SIG and the Project Office under MMERE to identify and develop a bankable feasibility study since 2007 to attract investor interest, and the IFC has been the transaction advisor to SIG providing support in the competitive selection of the investor and in negotiating on the commercial terms of the BOOT scheme. Developing large infrastructure and simultaneously introducing public-private partnerships in SIDS have unique challenges, and all stakeholders have been exposed for the first time to planning and design of utility-scale hydropower project, optimization of the power system with generation sources other than diesel units, transparent and competitive selection of investors, commercial terms of the Project, government guarantees and undertakings, negotiation with private investors, financial structuring, environmental and social safeguards, benefit-sharing mechanism, gender action plan, etc. SIG has significantly built their capacities in all these areas with the support of global experts in hydropower planning and design, environmental safeguards, migratory fish, land acquisition, gender, climate change resilience, benefit-sharing, power system planning, finance, legal and PPP. SIG is also benefiting from the continuous professional advice provided by the Dam Safety Advisory Panel and the Environmental and Social Panel to ensure that the Project is designed based on international best practice.
Pursuant to the Implementation Agreement and the PPA, the Project Company will operate the Project for 30 years. During this time, as per the requirement to be stipulated in the PPA, SIEA personnel will be trained to learn the O&amp;M of a hydropower plant. Since SIEA does not have any experience operating a hydropower plant, the training program is critical for SIEA to build its O&amp;M capacity of the plant which will be handed over to them at the end of the concession period. Such training will not only be on daily O&amp;M of the plant, but also on optimization of reservoir operations including flood control functions of the dam, sediment management and flushing/sluicing, monitoring and management of environmental impacts, periodic maintenance of major equipment, and replacement of electro-mechanical equipment after about 10-15 years.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The Project comprises four components (Tina River Hydropower Plant; Access Road; Transmission Line; and Technical Assistance), each with separate implementation arrangements. The Project Office in MMERE will have overall responsibility for ensuring effective project implementation across the components. In addition, SIG will form a Steering Committee comprising Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), MMERE, MECDM and the Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID); and the donors will form a Donor Coordination Committee to collectively ensure adequate implementation and fiduciary control, as well as to streamline reporting requirements by SIG.
For Component 1, the Project Company and the EPC contractor will enter into a fixed-price turnkey contract, and the works (Components 1 and 2) will be supervised by the Project Company. In addition, the Project Office will also supervise the construction to ensure that the laws and regulations of SIG are adhered to. In addition, the Independent Engineer, to be recruited and financed jointly by the Project Company and SIEA, will ensure that the provisions of the PPA are met. Furthermore, DSAP, recruited by the Project Office under Component 4, will review the detailed design and construction to ensure the integrity and safety of the hydropower plant with a particular focus on the dam.
The transmission line (Component 3) will be supervised by SIEA with the assistance of a consulting firm which SIEA maintains on a retainer basis. The independent monitoring agents and the E&amp;S Panel recruited by the Project Office under Component 4 will ensure the enforcement of measures stipulated in the Environmental and Social Management Plan and the Land Acquisition and Livelihood Restoration Plan.

Integrated Flood Management to Enhance Climate Resilience of the Vaisigano River Catchment in Samoa - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 16 October 2019,['Goal 13'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

This project will enable the Government of Samoa to reduce the effect of recurrent flood-related impacts in the Vaisigano River catchment, which flows through the area of the national capital Apia. It will aid the Government of Samoa enhance its capacities and information base to pursue an integrated approach to reducing vulnerability to flood-related risks; flood-proof key infrastructure in the Vaisigano River catchment; and upgrade downstream areas to increase river capacity and allow for the more rapid outflow of flood waters.
 

 


Implementation methodologies


Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


This project forms a part of a broad and comprehensive ridge-to-reef approach on integrated flood management in the AUA identified by the GoS. The approach will work on programmatic barriers in a phased manner, treating both consecutive geographic zones (starting with Vaisigano River Catchment to the Greater Apia Catchment and onwards to other micro and macro catchments in Samoa), as well as prioritized themes (starting with integrated flood management). Through various interventions in this project that focuses on capacity building (both technical and knowledge-based) and private sector partnerships (especially focusing on innovative approaches) an enabling environment will be created towards the achievement of the broader development goal of the GoS envisaged under the SDS. It will also contribute towards upscaling and replication in the broader Pacific region context as this project is one of the first in the region to address flood management in a comprehensive manner.
The project has included capacity building for upstream ecosystem enhancing activities that will protect and revitalize the water catchment, including: agroforestry projects, forest-pastoral systems and microbusinesses. This forms a strong element of knowledge and learning that will benefit communities and the businesses alike. From a business incubation angle, GCF resources will be used to extend the existing lending, guarantee, and training programs to new businesses that contribute to flood management in the catchment area, established under the SBEC and Development Bank of Samoa. Trainings will be designed to ensure interventions are maintained over the long-term.
In order to foster a sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation response to reduce water flow during extreme weather events, GCF resources will support enterprise development focused on reducing flood risk in the catchment area. Channeled via MoF, GCF resources will be used to facilitate the participation of vulnerable households in climate resilient agri-businesses through removal of financial barriers for technology transfer and/or adoption, business skills development, and to facilitate access to markets to ensure financial viability and sustainability. GCF resources will be used within existing government sponsored programs to increase uptake of climate-resilient packages that help farmers access resilient technological inputs, information, and finance (by reducing the cost of existing financial services packages for SMEs), and to access distant markets for climate resilient products, including through partnerships with the private sector.

"Dissemination of the Criminal Justice System among women, girls and boys - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform","Start: 01 February, 2020","['Goal 5', '\n\n\nGoal 16']","
Description

                            In 2016 we created two radio series to spread the Criminal Justice System, through dramatized stories. The first is ""Let's talk about Justice with DoÃ±a Justa"", dedicated to women from rural and urban areas. The second is ""Super Justina en AcciÃ³n"" dedicated to spreading the issue of justice among boys and girls (the idea is that they are not adults living within the model of justice and the rule of law).
In this second stage, we want to take advantage of this material to go to give workshops in communities across the country. Both series are made with a simple and easy to learn language, so we will use them as teaching material to teach talks and workshops. The objective is to contribute to the dissemination of the Criminal Justice System so that it becomes part of the Mexican culture. For that, we will go to the communities, first to train volunteer promoters and, with them, we will give workshops with women from rural and urban areas, and also with children.
To follow up we will be visiting each community to see the progress of the promoters and also to know the response of the people in the communities
                        
Expected impact

                            We are fully convinced that women's access to justice will stop the terrible wave of violence in our country. According to statistics, 8 out of 10 women have suffered some kind of violence throughout their lives. In the different approach strategies we have seen that the victim and victimizer paradigm is maintained, without the results having slowed the situation. We seek to empower women by making them aware of their rights and everything that the Para Justice System has for all women. The idea is that they appropriate the system and know where to turn in case of violence and to demand from their authorities to guarantee their access to justice. With these actions we are promoting gender equality, women's access to justice, the culture of peace and the rule of law. We also focus on boys and girls because we believe it is the best investment in the medium and long term since, when they are adults they will live within the culture of legality and peace.

Description/achievement of initiative

Measures that are urgently required to reduce the impact of increasingly intensive wave action on key infrastructure as a result of climate change induced sea-level rise and intensifying extreme events. Financial and capacity constraints at all levels that have prevented a sustainable coastal protection solution will be addressed. 35% of high-value vulnerable coasts will be made more resilient to withstand the effects of increased wave intensity, compared with the baseline of 7%. The investments will occur at locations that have high concentration of residences. The project will also strengthen institutional and community capacities for sustaining and replicating project results.

Support for facilitating learning and building knowledge including for generation, dissemination and use, is envisaged in four areas of project activities. The first will target government officials from DLS, PWD and DoE who will receive trainings on synthesis and analysis of beach profile data, coastal protection feasibility assessments, basic maintenance of coastal protection infrastructure, and ecosystem-based coastal protection approaches.
The second area targets students who are currently in a high school or university program so that they will obtain a higher degree in disciplines related to coastal protection such as civic/coastal engineering and oceanography. This programme will be supported only in the first 4 years of the project implementation so that, during the lifecycle of the GCF project, the students supported will have graduated and, as per the scholarship arrangement, come back to Tuvalu to work on the project to apply their knowledge and skills gained. The university partnership will also allow learning and knowledge-generation to be disseminated within and beyond Tuvalu, where academics and students will be invited to conduct research and or field-based studies. Not only will this allow young academics and experts in Tuvalu and in the region to interact with global experts in the field, but also, the knowledge and learning from Tuvalu regarding coastal resilience building can then be shared throughout the world.
The third area of knowledge sharing and learning will take place in the communities targeting both the administrators (the Kaupules and the Falekaupules) and community members. The administrators will gain better understanding about the process for participatory, gender-responsive development planning, budgeting and execution while community members will enhance their awareness about the importance of independent monitoring of the performance of the administrators, judged against the ISP. Officers from the Department of Rural Development will also enhance their knowledge of facilitating community dialogue for development planning as an independent facilitator of the process. In addition, this development dialogue platform will also be used to improve learning among community members about climate risks, the notion of island formulation process and the ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, data collection for coastal monitoring, coastal design options, maintenance responsibilities, and costs.

There is currently &gt; 7.3 billion tons of plastic in the Earth System, rising to 40 Bt by 2050. ~10 Mt of plastics reach the oceans every year; 12 Bt are projected to be in landfill by 2050. As these are released, the flux of plastics to surface waters, coastlines and oceans is amplified, with significant environmental, social and economic cost...
For plastics that have residual economic value there are systems to capture and reuse or recycle. However, in most cases, post-consumer waste polymers have no intrinsic economic value so if there are no policies in place, and consequently no collection and recycling, they are destined to end up in the sea. Current understanding of the pathways and fate of plastic in the environment is poorly constrained, with only fragmentary evidence restricted to parts of the cycle.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

The circular economy seeks to close the loop between product waste and manufacturing through recovery and regeneration of resources. A move to a circular economy has many potential benefits. It will increase the security of supply of materials and reduce production costs. It also encourages a focus on bio-based products and a reduced reliance on non-renewables such as fossil fuels. There are, however, many challenges associated with such a transition, such as a lack of cost-effective methods for the recycling of some bio-based products.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

The Ocean Conference  | Conservation and Wise Use of Mangroves and Coral Reefs in Latin America and the Caribbean ,Registered: 12 October 2019,"['goal 13', 'goal 15']","

The objective of the voluntary commitment is to increase the area and number of wetlands with mangrove ecosystems in Latin America and the Caribbean that are wisely used and conserved according to the Ramsar Convention guidelines and in line with the work plan of the regional initiative and the Strategic Plan of the Convention. To achieve this, Ramsar methodologies will be implemented in each country to:   1.	develop an inventory of priority wetlands with mangrove ecosystems for conservation Furthermore, 2.	Designate at least 14 key areas (one per country) with mangrove ecosystems as wetlands of international importance or under a national category with management plans developed for key areas. 3.Carry out a participatory rapid assessment of the ecosystem values and functions of 14 Ramsar sites with mangroves. 4.Capacity development workshops for member countries of this regional initiative on environmental flows and their implementation. 

These commitments are based on and will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Regional Initiative as outlined in their work plan, namely those related to: promoting the generation and exchange of knowledge of the cover and current status of conservation of mangroves and coral reefs among the involved Contracting Parties, through inventories and ecosystem studies to extend the Ramsar Sites list. 
Developing a regional approach for the conservation and wise use of mangroves and coral reefs by strengthening regional capacities. 
Achieving the effective management of mangroves, coral reefs and associated wetlands through integrated watershed and coastal zone management, including adaptation and mitigation measures to climate change. 
Encouraging, strengthening and disseminating basic and applied research, including traditional knowledge, socio-economic studies of mangroves, coral reefs and associated wetlands as a bottom line for the decision making the process that respond to national, regional and local agendas. 
Follow up will be done through meetings of the Regional Initiative for the Conservation and Wise Use of Mangroves and Coral Reefs and their reports as well as through the Ramsar Sites database and other reports such as those submitted to the COP. 
The Regional Initiative operates under the framework and guidelines of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and has a governance structure that was established in 2009.

Description

                            The Youth Climate Council, is an independent youth-led advisory board to the climate minister. The Youth Climate Council is something the Danish Youth Delegates and the Youth Council (an umbrella organisation of 75 youth-led organisations including for example scouts, student councils, and all the political youth parties) have successfully pushed for the government to establish. The Youth Climate Council gathers input from young people all over the country and formulates concrete policy proposals to the minister. The proposals are then included in the policy processes to give young people a channel for directly influencing the development of climate policies. We also have a local level Youth Climate Councils in some cities, showing how meaningful youth engagement is important on all decision making levels. We want to show that young people are not just â€œenergeticâ€ and â€œgood at thinking out of the boxâ€, we are also knowledgeable and capable of translating our ambitions into concrete policies that governments need to listen to.
                        
Expected impact

                            The Youth Climate Council meets with the Climate Minister several times per year to give policy inputs on behalf of Danish young people. This will accelerate climate action because more ideas are action.  put into play, and because young people are more ambitious on the climate agenda than older generations. The Youth Climate Council also participates in external events to gather input from young people and to raise awareness about climate  policies in all parts of society. This year they have participated in more than 60 external events. They furthermore contribute to the public debate by frequently making statements in the media and writing opinion pieces to newspapers. This awareness raising builds public support for more ambitious climate

Description

                            Achieving progress on the Sustainable Development Goals will require governments to coordinate, consult and work across policy areas in an unprecedented way. It will require the strategic use of budget, procurement and regulatory tools and the design and implementation of innovative, forward-looking policies and programmes. All these issues can be part of a â€˜governanceâ€™ agenda, which not only is a goal in itself, but also an essential enabler for the achievement of all other goals.
With a view to strengthening the public governance practices that are pre-requisites for effective SDG implementation, the Global Hub will draw on insights from OECD member and partner country experiences and help governments develop fit-for-purpose public governance systems to deliver on the SDGs.
                        
Expected impact

                            The Global Hub on the Governance for the SDGs will help governments in implementing the 2030 Agenda by addressing central governance challenges. It does so by operating as a helpdesk for countries and institutions to draw on as needed. It provides an online Knowledge Platform for national experts and practitioners to interact, learn from each other and give advice on tackling specific governance bottlenecks. Its support is tailored to national priorities and circumstances and engages public authorities and other key stakeholders directly in a dialogue to build capacity for the effective use of governance mechanisms for the SDGs.
Through its work, the Global Hub will help countries enhance their governance practices in the following areas:
â€¢	Creating a whole-of-government approach to address the SDGs in an integrated way.
â€¢	Equipping policy practitioners with the right leadership skills and competencies, including people management and technical skills.
â€¢	Enhancing budgeting tools to account for the SDGs and other cross-cutting priorities such as environmental and gender considerations.

Description

                            This Plan departs from the statutory mandate, addressed to public authorities, to guarantee the right to decent housing to everyone. More specifically, the Plan revolves around four strategic axes: preventing and addressing the housing emergency, ensuring housing really serves a social function, increasing the number of affordable flats and renovating the existing housing stock. Each axe includes 3-4 lines of action which, in turn, are translated into a total of 59 measures. For each measure the Plan depicts a description of the context, the statutory responsibilities accruing to each public body, the foreseen timing and the applicable area.

In the city of Barcelona there is a wide variety of public agents that have competencies in housing, whether municipal or supramunicipal. The development of integrated housing policies requires a strong joining-up effort, aiming at the confluence of all services related to housing, including citizen attention. The Plan itself foresaw administrative changes to progress along this line. Hence, in 2017 the Barcelona Municipal Housing and Rehabilitation Institute (IMHAB) was set up, as the municipal body responsible for the promotion and construction of public housing, management of the available housing stock and rehabilitation of flats and buildings. The political leadership of the Plan corresponds to the City Councillor for Housing and Rehabilitation, who in turn is part of the Social Rights area of City government.

Citizen participation in municipal housing policies is channelled through the Social Housing Council of Barcelona (CHSB). Its functions include the monitoring and evaluation of the cityâ€™s housing plans. It does it through the generation of debate and the formulation of proposals for action. The results of its activity are published in specific reports. The CHSB works through a plenary, a permanent commission and a series of working groups, whose number and composition will be adjusted along the development and according to the needs of the Right to Housing Plan. The Barcelona Observatory for Architectural Rehabilitation (OBRA) is an association that serves as a meeting point for organisations and individuals who have a professional or cultural interest in the rehabilitation of the cityâ€™s building stock. The reflections and proposals made within the OBRA are transferred to the CHSB. However, the Plan seeks an efficient integration of the participatory endeavours around this issue.

Barcelona has a wide system of indicators that allow the monitoring of municipal action. At the moment this global system is in reformulation. Once the new model is available, the housing indicators will be adapted so that they can keep the historical series developed so far and at the same time they allow to introduce new indicators to evaluate the essential elements of the Plan. On the other hand, in order to evaluate compliance with the plan and monitor it, an annual execution report will be presented, which will be presented among others to the Barcelona Social Housing Council, The state of development of each one of the planned actions and the needs of reformulation of those considered necessary.

Description

                            In January 2018, the Coca-Cola system in Japan announced its 2030 Packaging Vision. Based on the global vision of The Coca-Cola Company to be collecting and recycling 100% of packaging (e.g. bottles and cans) used for Coca-Cola products sold worldwide by 2030, it targets the creation of a recycling-oriented society in Japan with respect to PET bottles, laying out a concrete action plan for activities around three pillarsâ€”Design, Collect and Partner. 

In light of progress made through these initiatives, we decided in July 2019 to bring forward attainment of goals in Japan and aim for an even more comprehensive â€œWorld Without Waste.â€ Specifically, we have set new goals, including the following: (1) Achieve at least 50% recycled PET plastic usage by 2022 and increase that to 90% by 2030; (2) Switch to recyclable materials for packaging of all products sold in Japan by 2025; (3) Switch to 100% sustainable materials for all PET bottles by 2030 and aim for zero use of new fossil fuels.

The focus for â€œDesignâ€ is on switching to sustainable packaging materials and designs. Here, â€œpackagingâ€ refers to cans and glass bottles, too, not just PET bottles. In Japan, importance will be placed on promotion of bottle-to-bottle recycling, whereby PET bottles used for beverages or other products are collected and recycled for use in new PET bottles. The original target for this initiative has been brought well forward and the following figures were newly established. First, at least 50% utilization of recycled PET plastic is to be achieved by 2022. By 2030, the bottle-to-bottle recycling rate will be increased to 90%. By 2025, recyclable materials will be adopted for packaging of all products sold in Japan. The same year, PET bottles for all products will use sustainable materials (recycled or plant-based PET plastic). And by 2030, all materials used will be sustainable, the aim being to fully introduce packaging that does not require any new fossil fuels. Also by 2030, PET material usage per bottle will be reduced by 35% (compared to 2004).

For â€œCollect,â€ the aim is to be collecting one PET bottle for every Coca-Cola product sold in Japan by 2030. We also put effort into awareness-raising activities, for example through installation of recycling boxes and promotion of correct sorting of PET bottles and their caps and labels after use.

For â€œPartner,â€ the Coca-Cola system looks to help lift already very high PET bottle and can collection and recycling rates in Japan even further through collaboration with central and local government, the beverage industry and local communities on efforts to build and maintain more reliable packaging collection and recycling schemes. Taking advantage of its broad-reaching network, the Coca-Cola system aims to realize a World Without Waste by connecting with all stakeholders. For example, Coca-Cola Japan is conducting a survey of waste flows from land into rivers jointly with the Nippon Foundation. The findings will be complied for composing a public statement on policy recommendation for even more effective plastic resources use in Japan.
                        
Expected impact

                            We are contributing toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Coca-Cola system in Japan implements sustainability initiatives in three domainsâ€”individuals (consumers), community, and environmentâ€”split into a total of nine core areas: beverage benefits, active healthy living, community, workplace, women, 2030 Packaging Vision, water stewardship, energy and climate, and sustainable agriculture.

We examine the relevance of initiatives in the three domains and nine core areas to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and support meaningful projects and partnerships that help communities achieve the goals. Working toward attainment of the SDGs is one way we contribute to the resolution of social problems in the community.

Under &quot;environment&quot; domain, 2030 Packaging Vision (updated July 2019) for a â€œWorld Without Waste,â€ we (1) Promote use of recycled or plantâ€‘based PET; (2) Help improve PET bottle and can collection and recycling rates in Japan; and (3) Help keep communities clean, for example through cleanup campaigns, and actively participate in awareness activities about a World Without Waste.

Building Legal Empowerment Technologies - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 1 October 2019,['Goal 16'],"
Description/achievement of initiative

Our Legal Empowerment and Technology project accelerates action by partnering with justice communities to advance the practice of technology-enabled legal empowerment strategies. These practices strive to close the civil justice gap by lowering barriers to information, building capacity, and empowering community members to use the law. By using co-design to develop prototypes in justice communities across the US, these prototypes could be replicated or scaled further increasing access to justice. Equity-based co-design is an innovative method of building legally empowering technological tools that truly serve community needs. With the help of community-led technologies, we can find Justice for All.
 

 


Implementation methodologies



Pro Bono Net has developed a Tech for Legal Empowerment Cohort, comprised of three justice communities, and has begun working with this cohort to develop and test new digital tools that will strengthen community non-legal navigator and community lawyering models, all with the aim of creating a more inclusive and responsive justice ecosystems. In addition, Pro Bono Net intends to convene a broader Tech for Legal Empowerment Learning Network of allied legal empowerment leaders and stakeholders in the US to build a framework for how technology can enable the scaling community lawyering initiatives and meaningful roles for lay advocates. This Network will convene in person at upcoming engagements as well as online via webinars and roundtables.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


The Legal Empowerment and Technology Initiative will build capacity with partners by supporting the development of three pilot projects. The Legal Empowerment and Technology Fellow will help train each partner in the use of equity-based co-design methodologies by providing resources, feedback, and artifacts. The pilot tools created by each cohort member will also strive to build capacity for the cohort memberâ€™s own legal aid organization and/or the community at large. Pro Bono Net will continue to advise each cohort member as their respective technologies are rolled out and improved over time.

In addition, we will hold a daylong convening in the spring of 2020 at Georgetown University Law Center to bring together a diverse group of approximately 25 leaders and stakeholders, including members of this projectâ€™s cohort, to discuss the role of digital tools in expanding roles for lay advocates and innovative approaches to community-driven justice initiatives. Following this convening, we will produce and distribute to the field at large a final toolkit and national webinar with the results of this initiative and approaches to replicating or building on successful strategies deployed by the Tech for Legal Empowerment cohort.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


This initiative is coordinated by a Legal Empowerment and Technology Fellow, whose responsibility is to oversee convening, technical assistance, and co-design activities with a geographically distributed Tech for Legal Empowerment cohort. The Fellow also manages prototyping activities, including working with designers and developers to create and refine prototype tools. The Fellow will provide peer-to-peer networking and information-sharing support to the cohort via regular webinar convenings. The project's design is shaped by input from cohort members, our research partner at Georgetown University Law Center, the project funder and other key stakeholders in the legal empowerment arena. The evaluation of the program will encompass a variety of measures of success such as the number of people with legal needs reached through the pilot projects in three jurisdictions, and the extent to which this represents an increase over traditional outreach methods. The evaluation will also use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to assess project outcomes.

Investing in a Better World - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 25 September, 2019","['Goal 12', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description

                            DFIDâ€™s Investing in a Better World initiative is finding out more about the UK publicâ€™s interest in investing that helps achieve the Global Goals.Working with PwC, DFID ran an online survey of over 6,000 people, which included a large nationally representative sample. This was supplemented with a consultation of over 2,000 people through public feedback forms and public events. Industry stakeholders were engaged to contextualise findings from the survey through five roundtables and 44 interviews.
                        
Expected impact

                            DFID research into peopleâ€™s views on sustainable investing has revealed just over two thirds of UK savers, 68%, would like their investments to be responsible and impactful â€“ by taking impact on people and planet into consideration, alongside financial factors, in investment decisions. This is particularly clear among those with assets over Â£25,000 (77%) who are the most likely to hold investments now. High levels of interest are also found among millennials (74%) who represent the future of the investment market.

Sustainable investing, where impact on people and planet (e.g. particular SDGs) are taken into consideration alongside financial returns, is growing. In the UK, the sustainable investment industry is now valued at Â£1.2 trillion and has grown by 5.5% year-on-year over the last seven years. 

While this type of investing is important to people, the survey suggests that many people are not investing this way because the industry still needs to further:
o	improve the availability and accessibility of products;
o	raise standards and develop common terminology on sustainability and impact;
o	address misconceptions on risk and return, where many people mistakenly think that sustainable investing inherently means that profits will be lower; and
o	share clear and simple information about sustainable investing. 

The research also outlines the market trends that are making progress against these areas.

These results will be used to inspire further change in industry in order to mobilise more capital to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.

The new Impact Investing Institute (supported by DFID and DCMS) will work to make it easier for people to invest for impact.

Corporate Strategic Auditing Training in Corporate Accountability for Climate Change in Asia - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,Registered: 26 September 2019,"['Goal 4', '\n\n\nGoal 5', '\n\n\nGoal 13', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description/achievement of initiative

BACKGROUND OF INITIATIVE/COMMITMENT: 

Climate change remains an issue that is primarily seen as one of operational efficiency rather than the creation of long term sustainable value. The majority of companies have focused their efforts on those actions that provide clear and relatively low risk returns, and those where the costs are relatively modest. This wait and see approach, perhaps unsurprisingly, is particularly prevalent in situations where the actions involve significant capital expendituresÂ  or where the actions could commit the company irrevocably to a specific course of action. The logical conclusion is that companies should think about climate change-related risks and opportunities in a similar manner to other business risks and opportunities.Â 

We need to train our young people and adults (our future leaders) working in the â€œrealâ€ world to frame climate change as a strategic issue. That is, people working in either publicÂ or private sector need to have corporate strategic auditing competencies to assess how climate change may affect their businesses and, based on this assessment, make ethical decisions that allows them to protect their business against downside risks, maximize upside opportunities and ensure that their business strategies are not a one way bet on climate change policy (in either direction).


MAIN OBJECTIVE OF INITIATIVE/COMMITMENT:

The Association of Certified Strategic Auditors (ACSA) will provide corporate strategic auditing training for 10,000 young people and adults in Asia by 2030 in ""Corporate Accountability for Climate Change"", andÂ also carry out personnel certification as ""Certified Strategic Auditors"" to advance theÂ knowledge of climate change with continuing, relevant, and valuable professional development and networking.


 

 


Implementation methodologies



Approved trainers by the Association of Certified Strategic Auditors (ACSA) will be appointed and posted to various venues in Asia to conduct face-to-face corporate strategic auditing training in corporate accountability for climate change. ACSA will also conduct the train-the-trainers programs to expand the pool of trainers to meet the main objective of the initiative/commitment to target at about 1000 young people and adults per year till 2030 to be trained in corporate accountability for climate change in Asia. ACSA will adopt competency-based training (CBT) approach in its teaching methodology, and participants will be measured against the various competencies.



Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer 


ACSA will work closely with NGOs, private and public institutions, and also tertiary institutions to provide opportunities for qualified people to be trained as trainers for the initiative/commitment. Trainers will be trained in both face-to-face, blended and online teaching methods for the initiative/commitment. ACSA will provide online training program for Corporate Strategic Auditing Training in Corporate Accountability for Climate Change in Asia via CANVAS platform for both blended and online training for young people and adults that lack the opportunities to attend the face-to-face training. CANVAS platform will allows students to access their courses and groups using a mobile device. Students can submit assignments, participate in discussions, view grades and course materials. The app also provides access to course calendars, To Do items, notifications, and Conversations messages.  Participants will need to create Canvas accounts and are available for both Android and IOS devices which are portable and transferable, and can be used in any country in Asia.



Coordination mechanisms/governance structure


The Association of Certified Strategic Auditors (ACSA) will provide various physical, human and financial resources to kick start the initiative/commitment at the first instance, and concurrently working closely with NGOs, private and public institutions, and also tertiary institutions in Asia to provide funding for young people and or adults to attend the corporate strategic auditing training. 

ACSA will enter into various collaboration with NGOs, private and public institutions, and also tertiary institutions in Asia  for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and also financial resources for the initiative.The management of the initiative/commitment will be delivered through the Association of Certified Strategic Auditors (ACSA), in consultation with various stakeholder networks for governance arrangement through regular quality assurance audit.

Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) - Relaunched to accelerate progress on decarbonising road transport - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 17 May, 2019","['Goal 3', '\n\n\nGoal 7', '\n\n\nGoal 11']","
Description

                            The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) has set new targets to raise ambitions globally for improving vehicle fuel economy, which is vital for achieving SDG 7.3 on energy efficiency. These targets are ambitious, trackable, policy relevant, and easily communicated.

First established in 2009, GFEI re-launched in 2019 to accelerate action on improving vehicle efficiency and the transition to low-carbon vehicles. This includes a wider focus across all sectors â€“ including light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, motorcycles and buses. GFEI now works with around 70 countries, and a range of international and regional organisations, such as SE4ALL, the G20, and the UNFCCC. 

GFEI has set global targets to double average light duty fuel economy by 2030, and reduce it by 90% by 2050. GFEI is based on detailed data and technical analysis published through a working paper series of technical papers. GFEI has also established the only regular global monitoring of fuel economy trends.

GFEIâ€™s in-country support started with four pilot countries, and has expanded to over 70 countries. GFEI provides policy support through our â€˜toolkitâ€™ approach, which enables countries to custom-build solutions based on a full understanding of their own unique circumstances and fleet characteristics

GFEI engages at high-level events, and in key global processes, bringing the issue of vehicle efficiency to the fore, and pressing for effective policy globally, regionally, and nationally. The GFEI partners work together and collaborating with regional experts to support governments and policy makers in implementing fuel economy policies. This includes providing input into major international processes, such as the G20 Transport Task Group and the SDG7 technical group.
                        
Expected impact

                            GFEIâ€™s main goal for passenger vehicles, in line with SDG 7.3, is to double the energy efficiency of new vehicles by 2030. This will also help mitigate climate change by reducing harmful CO2 emissions. For this reason GFEI has been recognised by SEforALL as an accelerator initiative, and by SLoCaT (the partnership on Sustainable Low-Carbon Transport) as a â€˜quick winâ€™ at the COP 21 Climate talks. GFEI also provides support to the G20 Transport Task Group. The improvement in fuel economy between 2005 and 2015 led to an annual saving of 1.5EJ of energy, equivalent to the entire transport-related energy use of Italy per year.

GFEIâ€™s new targets and expanded approach will significantly improve fuel economy across the whole of the road transport sector, contributing to SDG7, by improving energy efficiency and cutting fuel use, and also reducing carbon emissions (SDG13). There are a range of other co-benefits, including improved air quality, lower oil imports and consumption, and a transition to low-carbon renewable energy.

GFEIâ€™s targets aim to reduce carbon emissions per vehicle by 90% for light-duty vehicles by 2050, 70% for heavy-duty trucks, and 95% for buses and two- and three-wheeled transport. Overall (because of expected increases in vehicle numbers, this would lead to a fleetwide CO2 reduction target of 65% by 2050 compared with 2005. In 2050, this would lead to 

For Heavy Duty Vehicles, GFEI has set a target of improving average fuel economy by 35% by 2035. This would save 9 million barrels of oil per day, and 1-2 billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2035. Half of these savings would come from just two countries â€“ China and India, which would save around a quarter each.

Liechtenstein Initiative â€“ For a Financial Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 01 September, 2018","['Goal 5', '\n\n\nGoal 8', '\n\n\nGoal 16']","
Description

                            The â€œLiechtenstein Initiativeâ€ - a public-private partnership between the Governments of Liechtenstein, Australia and the Netherlands, as well as Liechtenstein private sector actors and foundations - puts the financial sector at the heart of global efforts to end modern slavery and human trafficking, in line with the 2030 Agenda. In a first phase, its Financial Sector Commission (FSC) has worked on a blueprint for the global financial sector to accelerate engagement to tackle these crimes. The â€œBlueprint for Mobilizing Finance Against Slavery and Traffickingâ€ will be launched on 27th September and aims at helping relevant financial sector actors, including banks, pension funds, insurers, fintech, regulators and more, to take action against modern slavery and human trafficking. It sets out five ambitious goals which these actors can implement through individual and collective action. In the second phase of the â€œLiechtenstein Initiative for Finance Against Slavery and Traffickingâ€ (FAST) will provide guidance and support to implement the goals and actions set forth by the Blueprint. It will review the implementation and bring together a â€œnetwork of networksâ€ which will deal with different dimensions of implementation to exchange progress made, lessons learned and challenges. The stories of change, and the insights they reveal, will then inform the design and delivery of a FAST Review Conference, to be held in 2021, in Liechtenstein
                        
Expected impact

                            The Financial Commissionâ€™s Blueprint is expected to impact the improvement of the following five goals:
1. Compliance with laws against modern slavery and human trafficking.
2. Knowing and showing modern slavery and human trafficking risks.
3. Using leverage creatively to mitigate and address modern slavery and human trafficking risks.
4. Providing and enabling effective remedy for modern slavery and human trafficking harms.
5. Investment in innovation for prevention.

Peace Boat's Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassador Programme and Alumni Accelerator - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 26 August, 2019","['Goal 13', '\n\n\nGoal 14', '\n\n\nGoal 17']","
Description

                            The Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassador Programme brings youth from small islands on the frontline of the climate crisis to travel onboard Peace Boatâ€™s its ship to raise awareness of the impacts of the climate crisis and ocean degradation. This programme highlights the stories and experiences of young people at the forefront of injustices brought about by climate change, amplifying their voices calling for action. Press conferences, public events and meetings with government representatives are organized in the different countries that the youth visit with Peace Boat. The ambassadors have the opportunity to present their experiences to local and national media to amplify their message. They also use their own social media channels to outline the programme and conclusions. Participants engage in capacity development training programmes onboard and in ports and after the voyage,  use the experience and knowledge gained to contribute to their communities and internationally, organizing events with young people to pass the message and keep raising awareness on the urgent need for action for our ocean and climate.

The programme focuses on Sustainable Development Goal 13, â€œTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impactsâ€ (Climate Action) and Sustainable Development Goal 14, â€œConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable developmentâ€ (Life Below Water), and explores the relationship between these goals and the other goals of Agenda 2030. In particular, Education, Peace and Justice, Partnerships and Gender equality.  Through seminars , study programmes and discussions particip[ants and those they meet engage with the SDGs and understand their importance as well as solutions and challenges and challenges to implementation.
                        
Expected impact

                            Having organized three separate editions of the Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassador Programme over three years, Peace Boat has provided capacity development for a total of twenty-six youth leaders from Small Island Developing States.  The countries represented to date are: Fiji, Palau, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Seychelles, Maldives, Mauritius, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados, St Lucia and Belize.



To scale up the programme going in its fourth year, Peace Boat plans to: 

- Provide an online platform for an alumni network which will allow participants of the programmes to continue to work on projects together once returning to their home communities. Having built the foundations of the network through personal interaction and shared experiences onboard, the work can be continued and scaled up with youth from the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Caribbean through the online platform. The alumni network will also encourage and facilitate cooperation amongst graduates of different editions of the programme who may or may not have the opportunity to meet in person providing further amplification and acceleration. 

- Increase the number of youth engaged in the programme and engage youth representatives from Small Island Developing States not yet represented in the programme.

- Provide support for youth from the same country and/or region to work together to organize events and training programmes in their home countries including providing media tools and documentary videos related to the programme and the SDGs covered.

- Provide opportunities for OCYAP alumni youth to participate in international conferences related to the Sustainable Development Agenda at side events and collaborations with partners and through Peace Boatâ€™s position as an NGO with consultative status to UN ECOSOC and with Observer Status to UNFCCC

- Provide opportunities for alumni youth to scale up their own community projects through Peace Boat visits to Small Island States as part of the Global Voyages.

Swedenâ€™s goal â€“ becoming the worldâ€™s first fossil-free welfare state - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform,"Start: 12 July, 2017","['Goal 7', '\n\n\nGoal 9', '\n\n\nGoal 11', '\n\n\nGoal 12', '\n\n\nGoal 13']","
Description

                            Sweden remains committed to continue taking a leading role on climate action. With the Governmentâ€™s overarching goal of becoming the worldâ€™s first fossil-free welfare state, Sweden wants to showcase a prosperous, inclusive and equal society without greenhouse gas emissions. To succeed with the transition, the Swedish Parliament decided by a large political majority to introduce a climate policy framework in 2017. The framework consists of a climate act, a climate policy council and new climate targets, including to reach net-zero emissions by 2045 at the latest, and thereafter negative emissions. This framework is the most important climate reform in Swedenâ€™s history and sets out Swedenâ€™s implementation of the Paris Agreement while providing long-term conditions for business and society in the transition. Sweden encourage all countries to adopt similar institutional arrangements in their own national settings.

The Swedish Government is now speeding up its efforts. In the four-party policy agreement from January, the Government has committed to many new ambitious climate reforms. This fall, the Government will appoint an inquiry to review all relevant legislation to make sure it is in accordance with our climate policy framework, and another inquiry will investigate how to fully phase out fossil fuels and forbid fossil-driven cars in the transport sector. An inquiry on how negative emissions can be incentivized will deliver its report in January 2020, and a new investment support scheme has been created in order to get started negative emissions started already now. The Government is also introducing numerous policies for the transition towards a fossil-free transport sector, including a sharpening of biofuel blending in diesel and gasoline, investments in charging infrastructure. Thirteen different industry sectors have themselves have committed themselves in action plans to become fossil free within the governmentâ€™s initiative â€œFossil Free Swedenâ€, which shows that the business side is also driving the transition in Sweden. Even regional and local actors are moving forward.

In the Budget Bill for 2020, additional investments have been announced. We have now doubled our support for the Industry Leap initiative, which for example help fund the HYBRIT-project of creating fossil-free steel. We have also added valuable assets to the Climate Leap, funding regional and local initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emission, making the transition possible across the country.

This fall, Swedenâ€™s first Climate Action Plan, as regulated in our climate act, will be presented to the parliament. In the Action Plan the Swedish Government intends to present ambitious policies that take us towards our goal of net zero emissions by 2045 at the latest.
                        
Expected impact

                            Swedenâ€™s goal of becoming the worldâ€™s first fossil-free welfare state, reaching net zero emissions by 2045 at the latest, responds directly to SDG 13. Nevertheless, the global shift from carbon-intensive to carbon-neutral development that is needed, will also contribute to the implementation of the whole Agenda 2030 â€“ notably SDGs 7, 9, 11,12. This major societal change starts with a profound shift in systems and technology to achieve cleaner air, better urban environment and safer energy supply. Financing needs to be redirected from fossil-based energy production to investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements and an energy and resource-efficient infrastructure and buildings with carbon-neutral materials.
